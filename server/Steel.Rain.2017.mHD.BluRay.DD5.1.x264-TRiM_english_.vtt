00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.830
I got you 50% more than the last time.

3
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.250
You need to give me at least 50.

4
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.420
Ma'am, come and have a look.
I'll give you a discount.

PYONGSONG, PYONGAN PROVINCE

6
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.130
The prices will be the same
no matter where you go.

7
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:46.930
Don't go.

8
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.470
Whatever, just leave then.

9
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.100
How much are these pair of slippers?

10
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.230
If it disappears,
they'll call you a thief.

11
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.040
Hands up.

12
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.470
Get back.

13
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.390
I didn't steal it.

14
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.680
It's my prescription drug.

15
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.980
He knows that, too. Please tell this guy.

16
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.650
How are you feeling?

17
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.940
Chief Ri.

18
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.860
-Give us some privacy.
-Yes, sir.

19
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.530
It looks like Du-won Kim
and Gwang-dong Park

20
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.250
are up to something.
They have even picked the D-day.

21
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
CHIEF
TAE-HAN RI

22
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.790
I tried to gather some intel and found out

23
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.000
that the two of them
have been in touch with In-chin Ryu

24
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.930
of State Security to sell us out
to the Chinese.

25
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:16.810
What are your thoughts?

26
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.980
What do think they're planning to do
on their "D-day"?

27
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.320
Could it be a coup?

28
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.410
The problem is that those traitors
are blocking access to the Great Leader.

29
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.490
Because of that,
I cannot report the situation to him.

30
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.670
I have no choice but to get rid of them,
so that I can report to him.

31
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:43.670
But...

32
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.920
Why not the agents
that are in the field now?

33
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.260
Hey.

34
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.640
Gwang-dong Park has
the Supreme Guard Command,

35
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.140
and Du-won Kim has State Security troops.

36
00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.810
If one of our agents fails to kill them,
there will be war.

37
00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:59.890
It's obvious.

38
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.780
But you left the organization a while ago.

39
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.030
Comrade Eom.

40
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:12.990
If you accomplish this mission,

41
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.450
you'll become a hero
who saved the country from a coup,

42
00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.210
and your family will get the respect
and privilege that come with it.

43
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.550
I'm the chief director of the RGB.
You have my word.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.680
-Thank you.
<i>-The nationwide voter turnout</i>

48
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.890

51
00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:46.690
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.570
<i>It was 72.4%. In Ulsan, it was 78.4%.</i>

54
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.660
Goodness, I give your mom so much money
for child support.

55
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.540
Doesn't she feed you?

56
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.540
She doesn't let us eat any junk food.

57
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.170
Eat up when she's not around.

58
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.420
-Daddy.
-Yes.

59
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.840
Can you and Mommy get back together?

60
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.930
Give me a good reason
why we should get back together.

61
00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.520
Mommy is a doctor,
and you work at the Blue House.

62
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.480
I used to be super cool,

63
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.940
but I can't brag about you two
because you're now divorced.

64
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.230
You used to be super cool?

65
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.240
Se-min.

66
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.320
Do your friends ever say
that they think you're rude?

67
00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.370
-Yes.
-They say that to you?

68
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.870
Then, you sure are my son.

69
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.750
Wait a second. Hang on, okay?

70
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.920
Dad, we have to leave at 6:00 p.m.
Mom is coming.

71
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.130
All right.

72
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.340
EXIT POLL RESULTS

73
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.140
Sir, congratulations.

74
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.020
It is neck and neck,

75
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.940
but all the channels
are predicting the same result.

76
00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.860
Se-rim, Se-min.

77
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.650
Did you guys have fun with Dad...

78
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.570
What is this?
Are you guys eating hamburgers now?

79
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.530
A special lecture?

80
00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.620
Oh, I'm just filling in?

81
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.460
Of course, I would love to.

82
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.670
You know that I'm an expert when it comes
to filling in or acting as a proxy.

83
00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.340
Right, yes.

84
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.590
Okay. I'll see you that day, then.

85
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.220
Take care.

86
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:45.350
Where did they go?

87
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.830
PYONGYANG

88

RESTRICTED AREA,
WARNING, DANGER

89
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.590
WITH YOU, I WILL OPEN
THE ERA OF UNIFICATION.

90
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.350
The guest for Peony Room is here.

91
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.100
Hello.

92
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.520
I hear that your boss is stressed out
because of the Kaesong Industrial Complex.

93
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.440
Yes, he is. Foreign Affairs will release
a statement tomorrow about where we stand.

94
00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.780
Chinese companies joining the complex
goes against the UN sanctions...

95
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:00.700
Come on.

96
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.450
Those factories will be fine
since they just produce household goods.

97
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.290
At this rate, six-party talks will totally
be held in the next administration.

98
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.210
Now is a good time to give them something.

99
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.670
That's the only way
we can make them listen, you know.

100
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.880
Isn't he the Minister of State Security,
Du-won Kim?

101
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.840
He's the big-shot power broker
in the DPRK. Did Number One eliminate him?

102
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:24.760
I don't think it was Number One.

103
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.300
THE MINISTRY OF STATE SECURITY
HONG-JANG RI

104
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.850
Officially, it was a car accident.

105
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.100
-Who's this man beside him?
-In-chin Ryu.

106
00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.770
He's the Chief of Chinese State Security
to North Korea.

107
00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.440
The last piece of intel I got from him

108
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:41.240
is that there will be
massive purges in North Korea.

109
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.410
The next administration
will have a lot to deal with.

110
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.250
So, what are your plans
for after leaving the Blue House?

111
00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:02.090
How about a faculty chair

112
00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:04.090
at Peking University's
East Asian Research Center?

113
00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:05.510
Interested?

114
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.520
-Do you like seafood stir-fry, sir?
-Of course.

115
00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.440
They make the best seafood stir-fry
in all of Korea.

116
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.060
-A medium seafood stir-fry, please.
-Sure.

117
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.530
-Actually, give us the large size.
-Sure, no problem.

118
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.030
<i>I hear there may be
massive purges in the North.</i>

119
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:29.120
It sounds like the power struggles there
have gotten quite serious, sir.

120
00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.250
Officially, both North Korea and China
closed the case as a car accident.

121
00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:38.000
Should I inform the president-elect?

122
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.550
President-elect Gyeong-yeong Kim
Vows to Open Era of Unification

123
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:41.880
He'll find out eventually.

124
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.130
It's more fun that way, don't you think?

125
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:46.010
Right.

126
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.340
Got it, sir.

127
00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:57.730
We have another customer.

128
00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.020
Yes, I know. That's for that table.

129
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.690
-What would you like?
-Skinny noodles, please.

130
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.240
It won't take long.

131
00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:36.600
Mr. Park will be in Kaesong on the 24th
for the funeral. Press one to call Uncle.

132
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.980
What happened to our country
at the beginning of the 20th century?

133
00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.560
-The Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910.
-Right.

134
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.400
But we need to use a proper name for it.
It's called Year of National Humiliation.

135
00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.240
After 36 years under Japanese rule,

136
00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.540
we regained our independence in 1945.

137
00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.790
But there's something
I must point out here.

138
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.120
In Europe, Germany, which started
the war in that part of the world,

139
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.380
ended up being divided into East and West.

140
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.340
But in Asia,

141
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:09.090
Korea got cut in half even though
Japan was the main culprit behind the war.

142
00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.510
Did we start the war?

143
00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:14.060
We failed in regaining independence
on our own.

144
00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.060
Right. What happened after that?

145
00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.940
-The Korean War.
-Yes, the Korean War.

146
00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.650
The very first proxy war
of the Cold War era

147
00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.320
broke out on our peninsula.

148
00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:31.820
During the colonial period,
so many people were drafted

149
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.780
and died in the war.

150
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.330
Including the comfort women,
three million people died in total.

151
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.000
Then, another three million
died during the Korean War.

152
00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.750
Basically, 20 to 25%
of the entire population died.

153
00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:46.300
In other words,
one of four or five of you died.

154
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.340
Throughout the 20th century,

155
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.140
our ideology was based on Japan.

156
00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.890
So, what did we do?

157
00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:56.260
We tried to become like Japan.

158
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.890
As a result,
Samsung is doing better than Sony now,

159
00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.480
and Hyundai has beaten Honda as well.

160
00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.310
That's how we took action
against the ideology called Japan.

161
00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.440
Then, what did North Korea do?

162
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.400
Why was Japan defeated?

163
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:13.450
-Nuclear bombs.
-Nukes.

164
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:15.990
Nuclear weapons.

165
00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.160
The North Korean regime

166
00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.460
will come to an end
because of nukes just like Japan did.

167
00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.540
-No way.
-Sounds crazy, right?

168
00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.340
You guys are probably thinking
that I'm talking a bunch of bullshit.

169
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.090
Hey, Se-yeong. Am I not right?

170
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.840
Everyone knows that
only nukes can stop nukes.

171
00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.930
-What is wrong with people?
-Goodness.

172
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:35.140
Well, let's be honest here.

173
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:39.560
Had we been nuclear-armed, the situation
would have never gotten this complicated.

174
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.730
We should at least have the nuclear option
like Japan does.

175
00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:46.560
Or, we should just declare that we'll
consider developing our own nukes

176
00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:49.730
-to position ourselves strategically.
-Taxi!

177
00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.900
Come on. You should go home.

178
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:54.950
-Gosh, Se-yeong.
-You're drunk. Get in.

179
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.410
-Just one more drink, okay?
-Goodness, come on.

180
00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.460
Gosh, Se-yeong.
Come on. Let's have just one more drink.

181
00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.370
-Please?
-Jeez, you're too much.

182
00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.840
-Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas to you, too!

183
00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.500
Hello, there! Happy Christmas.

184
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:12.130
-Let's go. I'm going in.
-Hey! Gosh, come on.

185
00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:15.010
They said hello to us.

186
00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:17.930
It's on me.
Let's have just one more drink.

187
00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:21.060
Hey, I have an early morning meeting
with the transition team.

188
00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.730
I'm going home. Have fun.

189
00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:25.350
Wait, Se-yeong. Jeez.

190
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:27.190
-Bye!
-Se-yeong.

191
00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:33.190
Hey, have just one more drink with me.
Goodness gracious.

192
00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.510
Eat up, In-yeong.

193
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.090
You're pretty and adorable.

194
00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.180
You're also a smart cookie,
and you get good grades.

195
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:04.180
So, just don't listen to
any South Korean music, okay?

196
00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:07.190
Daddy, have you heard of G-Dragon?

197
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.360
G-Dragon?

198
00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.110
He's a member of Big Bang.

199
00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.150
He's a world-famous musician.

200
00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.200
Even the Chinese and Russians
listen to his music.

201
00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:18.240
You wench!

202
00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:21.080
Do you want to ruin your life or what?

203
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:24.950
Listening to music from the South
could get all of us killed.

204
00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.040
Promise Dad
that you won't listen to their music.

205
00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:31.540
I said that the Chinese
and Russians listen to it, not me.

206
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.550
I won't listen to it.

207
00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:44.140
Hurry up and finish your food.

208
00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.730
What is going on?

209
00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.980
I have been given a mission again.

210
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:33.650
You'll be sent to the embassy
in Cuba soon.

211
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:35.280
Take this money.

212
00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:39.860
Cuba? What are you talking about?

213
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.740
It wasn't easy to get this opportunity,

214
00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.740
so just listen to me
and move there without me.

215
00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:48.500
I'm not sure what this is about,

216
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.830
but I won't go anywhere
until you come back.

217
00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:55.040
I'll take long.

218
00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.090
I'll join you when my mission is done,

219
00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:00.550
so just move there with In-yeong.

220
00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.400
Cheol-u!

221
00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:19.440
In-yeong wants to say goodbye to you.

222
00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:24.870
Daddy.

223
00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.950
Have a safe trip.

224
00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:37.880
It's cold, honey.

225
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:41.800
In-yeong must be cold.

226
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.930
Go back in.

227
00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:07.330

Wait at the vent window and greet him.

231

BE POLITICALLY PASSIONATE
AND RIGOROUSLY PRODUCTIVE

232

-Where is Park now?
-He's in Pyongyang, sir.

Get the chopper ready!

-Does that mean he...
-Yes, that's right.

Gosh, please.

Make sure there are no survivors.

It's a coup. I can't stay here!

Arrange things,

Su-mi...

300
00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.270
Loosen his clothes, too.
What if he can't breathe?

301
00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:34.520
I'm sorry, sir.

302
00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:41.570
Why is our Dear General's hand so cold?

Dear General!

304

Move. Make way!

305
00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:55.790
It will be on you

Yes. Noted, sir.

Open it already.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.980
Have you lost your mind?

318
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:06.480
This will take us to South Korea.

319
00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:08.950
What do you think will happen
if we go back up now? Get down.

320
00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:16.660
This is pine mushroom tea.

321
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.540
Don't worry. The guest first.
Go ahead and serve him first.

322
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:24.540
I guess she's nervous
to meet her new boss.

323
00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.210
I'm still the owner
of this place though, right?

324
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:31.380
Have some tea.

325
00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.510
Hang on a second.

326
00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.270
Gyeong-yeong,
was this your third election?

327
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:43.190
I participated in three nomination races,
but this was my second election.

328
00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:45.690
Oh, yes. That's right.

329
00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.320
Gyeong-yeong. You see,

330
00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.820
I have never been this happy
and relaxed since I became President.

331
00:28:55.330 --> 00:29:00.120
People point the finger at you
no matter what you do in this position,

332
00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:02.250
but no one criticizes me these days.

333
00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:06.840
Oh, Mr. Park.

334
00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:12.760
An MLRS from the US Army Second Division
went missing at dawn,

335
00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:16.260
and about 20 minutes ago,
the seized MLRS fired two Steel Rain bombs

336
00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:17.970
at the Kaesong Industrial Complex.

337
00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:20.680
The ROK-US Combined Forces Command
wants us to issue DEFCON Three.

338
00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.810
It was seized? Who seized the MLRS?

339
00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:27.270
The bodies found at the scene
were in our military uniform,

340
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.030
but their tags were fake.
We should look into it to find out more...

341
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:33.360
Wait, hold on.

342
00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:37.660
Aren't Chinese companies opening factories
in the Kaesong Industrial Complex today?

343
00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:40.870
I'm sorry to interrupt.

344
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.500
-The situation is very urgent.
-What is going on?

345
00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:48.630
The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs
is requesting us to let their people

346
00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:51.760
in Kaesong
through the Inter-Korean Transit Office

347
00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.800
-into our country.
-Let them in.

348
00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:56.470
We should help them.

349
00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.730
PASSENGERS GET OFF

350
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:25.920
We got a go-ahead. Let them through.

351
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.130
-Move!
-Come on.

352
00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:28.920
Move!

353
00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:35.550
INTER-KOREAN TRANSIT OFFICE

354
00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:43.640
THE CITY YOU WANT TO LIVE IN
ENTERPRISE CITY, PAJU

355
00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:35.530
The leader was killed in the bombing.

356
00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:39.160
A civil war has broken out,
and we need to deal with it first.

357
00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:44.040
Let me make one thing clear to you.
The nuclear weapons and Pyongyang.

358
00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.290
I have full command of them!

359
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:48.870
Now, tell me where you stand.

360
00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:01.510
How could you leak it to the press

361
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:03.810
without consulting us first?

362
00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:08.940
We've still got a few months left.

363
00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:18.780
JOANNE MARTIN,
CIA STATION CHIEF IN SOUTH KOREA

364
00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:16.540
Mr. Ri?

365
00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:27.890
Doctor! Help!

366
00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:30.230
I think it's this way.

367
00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.140
We're closed for the day.

368
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.400
Excuse me!

369
00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:38.610
You can't go in there!

370
00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.950
We don't deliver babies here.

371
00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:49.910
Look, I'm an obstetrician.

372
00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.120
I'll call an ambulance for you, so...

373
00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:54.210
Treat him.

374
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:58.340
I promise. I won't hurt you.

375
00:33:58.420 --> 00:33:59.300
I told you.

376
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:02.260
I'm an obstetrician.

377
00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.010
You should go somewhere else.

378
00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:08.010
-I won't call the police.
-You're still a doctor.

379
00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:11.140
Please treat him. He's severely injured.

380
00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:15.690
Please, Doctor.

381
00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:29.370
Isn't this man...

382
00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:31.910
-Be respectful.
-Be respectful.

383
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:41.500
General!

384
00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:43.260
What's your blood type?

385
00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:46.630
Su-mi.

386
00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:50.720
So, is your blood
going into the Great General's body now?

387
00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:53.930
I hope that...

388
00:34:54.930 --> 00:34:58.150
my blood is good enough
for our Great General.

389
00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:00.650
You must be so honored.

390
00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:05.490
The doctor...

391
00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.970
Chief Ri. It's me, Cheol-u.

392
00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:31.760
Gwang-dong Park didn't come to Kaesong,
but our leader did.

393
00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:34.100
We got bombed,
and the Guard Command shot each other.

394
00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:36.430
What is happening, sir?

395
00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.560
<i>Park beat us. It's a coup d'état.</i>

396
00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:40.650
<i>-Where are you now?</i>
-I'm in Ilsan, sir.

397
00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.690
<i>Ilsan? You mean in the South?</i>

398
00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:44.780
Yes, sir.

399
00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:47.610
I'm...

400
00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:50.370
with the Great Leader now.

401
00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:54.330
How is he? Is he alive?

402
00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:57.960
<i>He is alive,
but he's in critical condition.</i>

403
00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:01.460
Comrade Eom, listen carefully.

404
00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:04.300
<i>We must bring back his body at least.</i>

405
00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:07.720
<i>Park's coup will succeed
the moment he's convinced</i>

406
00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.130
<i>that the leader is dead.</i>

407
00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.050
Stay there with him

408
00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.850
and guard him at all costs.
I'll send a few guys soon.

409
00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:15.970
Yes, sir.

410
00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:28.030
These tanks belong
to Sariwon 815 Mechanized Corps,

411
00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:33.120
and these are from the 820 Armored Corps
of Pyongyang Defense Command.

412
00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.910
The 815 tanks that were defeated
in the battle

413
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:37.790
retreated back
and have joined Division Four,

414
00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:40.870
and the 820 Armored Corps is remaining
in the southern outskirts of Pyongyang.

415
00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.380
They're probably guarding the city.

416
00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:45.960
It's a coup, sir.

417
00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:49.670
We must quickly find out who's behind it
and whether it has succeeded or not.

418
00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:50.680
Yes, sir.

419
00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:53.390
Well, this still needs to be confirmed,

420
00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:57.770
but I received intel that North Korea's
Number One died during the bombing.

421
00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:01.020
-And? And what?
-Calm down.

422
00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:02.980
They may declare war.

423
00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:06.730
Mr. Kwak. I get that we're
in the last days of this administration,

424
00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:08.400
but you can't crash a ministerial meeting

425
00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:11.360
and deliver that kind of news
in such an offhand manner.

426
00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:12.990
Who's your source?

427
00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:15.950
The CIA on the death

428
00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:19.120
and the Chinese State Security
on the war, sir.

429
00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:25.880
I did what I could.

430
00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:32.550
He got shot
in the head, shoulder, and thigh.

431
00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.220
He was shot through the shoulder,
so I just patched the hole.

432
00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.060
From the thigh...

433
00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:42.730
I took this out.

434
00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:46.480
I think the femoral artery is ruptured,

435
00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:48.480
but all I could do was bandage the wound.

436
00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:53.780
The biggest problem is that there's one
inside the cranial cavity as well.

437
00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:56.830
I can't do it.

438
00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:58.950
Why can't you? You're a doctor.

439
00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:06.920
I'm an obstetrician, not a neurosurgeon.

440
00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:10.960
Unless there's a baby inside this belly...

441
00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:16.970
I just can't do it.

442
00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:23.060
My people are coming.
Please treat him just until they get here.

443
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:30.110
At my clinic, North Korea's...

444
00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.070
Their leader is here.

445
00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:36.490
No, I mean...

446
00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:37.410
Gosh!

447
00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:40.740
What are you doing in the dark?

448
00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:42.250
Oh god.

449
00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:44.040
I'm looking for some food for you guys.

450
00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.420
You keep food at a place like this?

451
00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:50.750
Yes, it's up here.

452
00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:54.340
It's hot. Here, try it.

453
00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:58.050
Isn't this <i>yibap</i>?

454
00:38:58.340 --> 00:38:59.720
I'm sorry? "<i>Yibap</i>"?

455
00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.100
This is <i>yibap</i>.

456
00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:04.060
Rice, you know.

457
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:07.480
Oh, I see. Rice.

458
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:09.310
We're eating white rice.

459
00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:15.700
-Su-mi, what's this black thing?
-I'll try it.

460
00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:21.410
Hey, it's really good. It has meat.

461
00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:27.830
I was going to get the ration ticket
exchanged for food

462
00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.880
after work today.

463
00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.670
There's no food at home.

464
00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:37.760
My dad and Jeong-min must be starving now.

465
00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:41.470
Hey, Min-gyeong.

466
00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:44.890
Why are you worried about those
in the comfort of their own home?

467
00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:46.850
They should worry about you if anything.

468
00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:49.020
Eat up.

469
00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:51.980
We must eat so that we can keep
the Great General safe.

470
00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:52.900
Okay?

471
00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.240
Eat this, too.

472
00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:04.490
Hey, good. Wipe your tears.

473
00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:09.080
Try the black stuff, too.
It's really good.

474
00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:11.630
It is tasty. She made it so easily, too.

475
00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:21.680
-Go stay inside the room.
-Yes, sir.

476
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:23.350
Let's go.

477
00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:46.080
Where is he?

478
00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:58.570
OPERATING ROOM

479
00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:07.870
AREUM OBSTETRICS CLINIC

480
00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:43.030
Drop the gun.

481
00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:37.670
Move over.

482
00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:10.370
Hold tight!

483
00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:30.640
Su-mi, look.

484
00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:33.560
The General is bleeding. Su-mi, look!

485
00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:39.940
I think it's my blood.

486
00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:42.400
Su-mi.

487
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:45.820
Help me lay her down on her back. Now!

488
00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:51.240
Su-mi! No...

489
00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.370
-Su-mi.
-You have to focus!

490
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:58.620
Keep your hand here.
Press down hard, okay?

491
00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:02.790
-Su-mi...
-We have to take her to a big hospital.

492
00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.340
She gave him her blood,
and she's bleeding too much now.

493
00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:08.170
-Su-mi, please wake up.
-We don't have time!

494
00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:09.840
No, we can't.

495
00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.390
Find a place to treat them in secret.

496
00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:16.720
Please don't let Su-mi die, sir...

497
00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:22.940
Su-mi, wake up. Please, Su-mi...

498
00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:26.860
Please do something.

499
00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:31.110
Hey, Su-hyeon.
I'm sorry to ask you this, but...

500
00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:48.210
This way. Hurry.

501
00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:54.800
-Hey, Suk-jeong.
-This way.

502
00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:56.350
Hey, what is going on?

503
00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:59.270
Shouldn't you take them to the ER?
You know that I'm a plastic surgeon.

504
00:45:59.350 --> 00:46:02.480
I'm an obstetrician.
At least you're a surgeon. Move over.

505
00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:05.400
Go in here. This way. Come this way.

506
00:46:07.690 --> 00:46:08.530
Hey.

507
00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:14.110
What...

508
00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:15.280
What happened?

509
00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:21.870
Please help us. I won't hurt you.

510
00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:25.790
I'm sorry, Su-hyeon. Please help them.

511
00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:28.750
Let's save her life first.

512
00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:56.700
HANDLING AND DOCUMENTATION
OF NARCOTIC DRUGS

513
00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:18.550
What are you doing?

514
00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:22.220
Why aren't you treating her?

515
00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:24.020
Doctor!

516
00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:30.770
Su-mi.

517
00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.150
Su-mi, no...

518
00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:39.160
You can't die! Su-mi...

519
00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:45.620
Su-mi...

520
00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:53.170
Mr. Kwak.

521
00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:57.380
We got an update from the scene
at the clinic in Ilsan.

522
00:47:58.090 --> 00:47:58.930
What did they say?

523
00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:01.720
Three bodies were found,

524
00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:04.350
and it looks like all of them
are North Korean agents.

525
00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:07.100
A Chinese van full of plush pandas
was also found at the scene,

526
00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:08.940
and it probably came from Kaesong.

527
00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:13.610
-Dead North Korean agents?
-About 20 minutes before the shootings,

528
00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:15.610
a 911 call was made from the clinic.

529
00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:16.650
What was the call about?

530
00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:19.820
The caller said that
the North Korean president was there.

531
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:21.280
What? Give me that?

532
00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:23.660
North Korea doesn't have a president.

533
00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:29.710
"Suk-jeong Kwon. She was born in 1980."

534
00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:31.380
Suk-jeong Kwon?

535
00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:35.420
"Areum Obstetrics Clinic"?

536
00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:40.390
NASTY WOMAN

537
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:05.790
Se-rim, I guess you were sleeping.
It's Daddy.

538
00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:08.500
Your mom's home, right?

539
00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:13.630
With Auntie Suk-jeong?

540
00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:15.380
She's still at the clinic?

541
00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.920
I see. It's nothing.

542
00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:22.090
I'm sorry I woke you up.
All right, sweet dreams.

543
00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:30.850
I'll be at this address.

544
00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:33.480
I want you to call me in an hour.

545
00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:36.650
If my phone is off, or if I don't pick up,
send the police...

546
00:49:36.730 --> 00:49:37.570
No.

547
00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:40.820
Send the special forces.

548
00:49:41.650 --> 00:49:43.620
-You got that?
-Pardon? Why?

549
00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:45.370
Don't forget. In an hour from now.

550
00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:47.240
-Is something going on?
-Call me in an hour.

551
00:49:47.330 --> 00:49:49.040
Mr. Kwak!

552
00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:51.710
I heard that North Korea is...

553
00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:55.080
just on the other side of the river
by the Jayu Motorway,

554
00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:58.550
but I guess it never really hit me.

555
00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:02.470
It's so close.

556
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:05.600
I'm sorry.

557
00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:08.310
Su-hyeon.

558
00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:10.230
Su-hyeon!

559
00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:15.230
Why do you never pick up your phone? Hey.

560
00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:21.240
Who are you?

561
00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:25.780
-Cheol-u!
-There you are, Su-hyeon. Gosh...

562
00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.780
Take their cell phones from them.

563
00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:31.080
I'm really sorry.
I sincerely apologize for...

564
00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:32.870
Don't worry. It's okay.

565
00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.790
Go bring something to tie them with.

566
00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:39.300
Sit!

567
00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:42.090
Sit down!

568
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:50.680
That man over there.

569
00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:54.560
He's your Number One, isn't he?

570
00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:57.110
He probably couldn't go back
because of the coup.

571
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:59.730
You guys crossed the border
with the Chinese, didn't you?

572
00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:01.780
Who are you?

573
00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:04.610
What a crazy coincidence.

574
00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:08.410
No, "coincidence" isn't the right word.
Shall we call this "fate"?

575
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:11.200
I'm the senior secretary
for Foreign Affairs and Security.

576
00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:12.700
I work for the Number One here.

577
00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:18.790
I'll help you.

578
00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:22.210
No matter how skilled you are,

579
00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:25.050
there isn't much you can do
with just that little girl there.

580
00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:28.090
Let's say your Number One gets
the treatment he needs and survives.

581
00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:29.390
We'll make sure he can live.

582
00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:32.520
But, then what?
How will you take him back to the North?

583
00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:34.310
You son of a bitch.

584
00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:37.850
Those men...

585
00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:41.690
who tried to kill you and Number One
in Ilsan.

586
00:51:41.770 --> 00:51:43.650
They're your people, right?

587
00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:45.400
In this situation...

588
00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:48.620
getting our help will be...

589
00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:52.040
-your wisest bet.
-Shut up, you prick.

590
00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:57.250
Your country will declare war soon.

591
00:52:02.250 --> 00:52:06.420
<i>We hereby declare war
on the US and South Korea.</i>

592
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:11.010
<i>American imperialists and their puppets,
South Koreans,</i>

593
00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:14.680
<i>bombed the Kaesong Industrial Complex
yesterday, targeting our Dear Leader</i>

594
00:52:14.770 --> 00:52:18.520
<i>and top commanding officers
who were on site.</i>

595
00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:23.480
<i>In response to this unpardonable atrocity,
the Supreme Command</i>

596
00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:27.860
<i>has decided to terminate
the armistice agreement and declare war.</i>

597
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:31.120
If you see them doing anything suspicious,
kill them all.

598
00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:34.290
<i>There will be nothing but victory
for our nation of heroes.</i>

599
00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:38.000
<i>Once war breaks out,
our people and mighty army</i>

600
00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:43.130
<i>will burn all those American invaders
and the pathetic mutts at the Blue House</i>

601
00:52:43.210 --> 00:52:46.710
<i>with our invincible nuclear bombs.</i>

602
00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:48.220
I'll declare martial law. Get ready.

603
00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:06.190
How is he?

604
00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:09.860
He could die if he isn't transferred to
a bigger hospital for surgery immediately.

605
00:53:10.570 --> 00:53:11.410
But...

606
00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:13.910
why did we declare war?

607
00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:17.870
<i>Hey, who's in control of Pyongyang now?
It's Gwang-dong Park.</i>

608
00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:21.960
<i>It was the only way
to stop the frontline troops</i>

609
00:53:22.170 --> 00:53:23.840
<i>from forcing their way into the city.</i>

610
00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:26.170
<i>This phone is being tapped.</i>

611
00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:28.630
<i>We got attacked in Ilsan and nearly died.</i>

612
00:53:30.130 --> 00:53:30.970
<i>I think...</i>

613
00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:34.510
We should ask
the government here for help.

614
00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:36.810
<i>That's the only way
we can save his life, sir.</i>

615
00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:39.270
Hey, Comrade Eom.

616
00:53:39.350 --> 00:53:40.770
<i>Make sure you aren't being tapped.</i>

617
00:53:55.370 --> 00:53:57.120
They declared war just for a show.

618
00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:58.370
It's all because of the coup

619
00:53:58.450 --> 00:54:00.580
led by Gwang-dong Park,
the Supreme Guard Commander.

620
00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:04.330
He did it to make sure
the frontline troops can't be mobilized,

621
00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:07.130
so the South must not
do anything reckless and just wait.

622
00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:08.920
You want us to do nothing and wait it out?

623
00:54:09.010 --> 00:54:10.340
Does that even make sense to you?

624
00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:13.220
Save our leader's life as you promised.

625
00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:16.050
And let our frontline troops
go to Pyongyang

626
00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:17.890
so that they can stop the coup.

627
00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:21.390
Please convince
your government to help us.

628
00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:24.770
It's the only way
we can save this peninsula.

629
00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:44.460
A nuclear strike on North Korea

630
00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:47.710
will result in immense damage
from EMP and radiation.

631
00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:40.560
If it absolutely cannot be avoided,
we will gladly go to war.

632
00:55:41.350 --> 00:55:44.560
However, we should only resort to war

633
00:55:44.810 --> 00:55:47.020
when all other options are exhausted.
And a nuclear war...

634
00:56:00.450 --> 00:56:01.280
He's right.

635
00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:04.620
We requested this meeting.

636
00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:09.170
We appreciate your cordial review
and suggestions regarding this matter.

637
00:56:09.250 --> 00:56:11.090
Could you please tell us

638
00:56:11.170 --> 00:56:14.420
roughly how much time can be given to us
without hindering the operation?

639
00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:44.910
CHEOL-U KWAK
I got Number One, but he's unconscious.

640
00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:47.750
As President of the Republic of Korea,

641
00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:49.750
-I order the preemptive nuclear...
-Mr. President.

642
00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:09.520
Mr. Kwak.

643
00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:12.690
These are what we found at the scene.

644
00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:19.360
This military uniform and the chocolate
were found inside the van.

645
00:57:19.450 --> 00:57:21.160
-Keep them separate.
-Okay.

646
00:57:24.830 --> 00:57:27.120
All clear. No threat of danger.

647
00:57:29.250 --> 00:57:31.960
-Send this to the digital forensic lab.
-Got it.

648
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:41.090
<i>My fellow citizens. In accordance
with Article 77 of the Constitution</i>

649
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:44.510
<i>as well as Articles Two and Ten
of the Martial Law Act,</i>

650
00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:47.470
<i>I declare nationwide martial law</i>

651
00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:50.600
<i>as of 6:00 a.m. on December 25.</i>

652
00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:52.980
<i>My dear fellow citizens.</i>

653
00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:56.320
<i>Please stay calm and go on
with your daily lives.</i>

654
00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:58.780
<i>I ask that you cooperate with us,
the government,</i>

655
00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:00.950
<i>and the Martial Law Command.</i>

656
00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:03.950
So, what do you think?

657
00:58:05.370 --> 00:58:08.870
According to the polygraph,
it looks like everything he said is true.

658
00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:12.830
What about the girl?

659
00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:15.080
I don't think she knows anything, sir.

660
00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:21.470
My, I must say...

661
00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:25.640
-You impressed me with this one.
-Thank you, sir.

662
00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:29.930
You went to see your ex-wife
during a national crisis

663
00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:31.850
and ended up capturing
the leader of our enemy.

664
00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:34.690
Not too bad for a stand-in.

665
00:58:35.770 --> 00:58:36.860
Good work.

666
00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:38.480
I'm very impressed.

667
00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:42.610
Have a good day, sir.

668
00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:00.170
He can't see us, right?

669
00:59:00.550 --> 00:59:01.420
That's right.

670
00:59:04.050 --> 00:59:06.340
-He has something to say.
-To me?

671
00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:14.390
How's the Great Leader?

672
00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:17.060
I have reported to my higher-ups
that your government is helping,

673
00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:20.360
so it will be your country's fault
if anything happens to him.

674
00:59:21.030 --> 00:59:23.900
Well, you people started this mess.

675
00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:25.860
Why do we have to take the blame?

676
00:59:28.410 --> 00:59:30.740
The first round is done,
so you should get some rest.

677
00:59:32.370 --> 00:59:34.080
If anything happens to him,

678
00:59:35.370 --> 00:59:36.620
there will definitely be war!

679
00:59:39.130 --> 00:59:40.000
Okay.

680
00:59:46.930 --> 00:59:48.510
<i>Chief Park of National Security must have</i>

681
00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:51.810
leaked the information about you getting
Number One while you were bringing him.

682
00:59:52.810 --> 00:59:55.140
-I heard they responded right away.
-Who are "they"?

683
00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:58.310
Those in the North will come
to confirm in person and talk.

684
01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:03.230
While you were gone, we almost agreed
to a preemptive nuclear strike.

685
01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.450
The President-elect said

686
01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:09.030
we should decide
after meeting their representative.

687
01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:11.660
We stopped the war for the time being.

688
01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.080
So, who's coming?

689
01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:14.910
And who will meet him?

690
01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:17.250
Well, that's the thing.

691
01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.170
We insisted on deciding what to do
after meeting them,

692
01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:21.590
but they won't tell us anything.

693
01:00:23.170 --> 01:00:26.470
Those at the Blue House keep insisting
that they'll send someone from their team.

694
01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:30.510
They obviously want all the credit.

695
01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:33.600
Chief Park is a very ambitious man.

696
01:00:37.310 --> 01:00:39.600
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

697
01:00:44.190 --> 01:00:45.150
What has he been up to?

698
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:47.400
He's just been sleeping, sir.

699
01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:49.990
-Has he eaten?
-He keeps refusing to eat.

700
01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:53.540
It's me.

701
01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:55.750
I picked up a burger for you.

702
01:00:57.250 --> 01:00:58.370
Do you know what a burger is?

703
01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:01.290
What's it called in the North?

704
01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:04.750
A bun with meat?
Is that how you folks call it?

705
01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:08.220
Try a taste of capitalism.

706
01:01:11.010 --> 01:01:12.680
I saw in the investigation report

707
01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:14.560
that your name is Cheol-u too,
Cheol-u Eom.

708
01:01:16.850 --> 01:01:19.100
Maybe we were really meant to cross paths.

709
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:21.020
We have the same name. I'm Cheol-u Kwak.

710
01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:23.900
What does your name mean?

711
01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:25.980
Mine means "bright world"
in Chinese characters.

712
01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:28.900
So, you were born in 1977.

713
01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:33.030
Then, I'm a year older.
Let's just talk casually like friends.

714
01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:39.160
Show me some respect, will you?
Answer me at least. Jeez.

715
01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:42.080
What's wrong?

716
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:45.250
Hey. Guys, call a doctor!

717
01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:47.010
-Now!
-It's okay.

718
01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:49.380
Just give me some painkillers.

719
01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:51.800
Take all this back.

720
01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:55.470
He's asking for this though.
Let's give him this.

721
01:01:55.890 --> 01:01:56.890
Sure, that's no problem.

722
01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:01.350
Here.

723
01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:07.190
You should get treated for your addiction
and quit drugs for good while you're here.

724
01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:11.280
You're still young, you know.
You have many years left to live.

725
01:02:12.450 --> 01:02:13.620
It looks like you're cold.

726
01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.500
Do you want the burger?

727
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:35.680
So?

728
01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:38.390
They'll use the tunnels
if their visit is confidential.

729
01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:40.390
Tunnels?

730
01:02:42.730 --> 01:02:45.900
We have dug about 20 underground tunnels
in the last 60 years or so.

731
01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:49.690
I heard that about five to six of them
can still be used.

732
01:02:52.030 --> 01:02:53.280
Underground tunnels, I see.

733
01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:59.370
Then, who's coming?

734
01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.660
The RGB controls and manages
all underground tunnels.

735
01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:07.000
Only the chief director can open them up
in emergency situations.

736
01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:10.880
The chief director? Are you talking about
Chief Director Tae-han Ri of the RGB?

737
01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:13.840
Wait.

738
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:17.550
From what I know,

739
01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:20.060
he's one of the most prominent
hardliners against us

740
01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.560
He's coming down here to stop the war?

741
01:03:25.350 --> 01:03:28.150
You guys can't handle my country
with such a dichotomous way of thinking.

742
01:03:28.690 --> 01:03:32.150
Just kill him as soon as he gets here
and start the war, then.

743
01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:34.070
Jeez, calm down.

744
01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:39.990
You're sure Tae-han Ri is coming, right?

745
01:03:41.490 --> 01:03:43.040
If our leader recovers,

746
01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:45.290
Gwang-dong Park's coup will fail.

747
01:03:46.330 --> 01:03:48.040
He'll come to make sure that's the case.

748
01:03:49.130 --> 01:03:52.130
Take me to where the meeting will be held.
I'll explain the situation to him.

749
01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:07.520
<i>The guy who brought Number One here</i>

750
01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:10.520
is close enough to Tae-han Ri
to report to him in person.

751
01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:13.190
-If we take him to the meeting...
<i>-Tae-han Ri?</i>

752
01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.530
Chief Director Tae-han Ri of the RGB?

753
01:04:15.610 --> 01:04:19.320
Yes, sir. It'll help him trust us
and speed up the talks.

754
01:04:19.410 --> 01:04:20.660
We don't work with guerrillas.

755
01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:22.200
-I have to go.
-What do you mean, sir?

756
01:04:22.290 --> 01:04:25.370
<i>Didn't he sneak into our country
and shoot people? I'm hanging up!</i>

757
01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:28.580
The meeting wouldn't be happening
if it weren't for him.

758
01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:30.170
-What did you just say?
<i>-I'm sorry, sir.</i>

759
01:04:30.250 --> 01:04:31.500
<i>I thought you hung up.</i>

760
01:04:41.890 --> 01:04:43.180
<i>This red dot here</i>

761
01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:45.810
<i>shows the GPS location
of Chief Park's car.</i>

762
01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:47.480
<i>Just follow the signal, sir.</i>

763
01:04:55.690 --> 01:04:57.570
Have they agreed to send our leader

764
01:04:57.820 --> 01:04:59.610
back to the North when he recovers?

765
01:05:02.410 --> 01:05:03.580
They probably will.

766
01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.790
Unless he wants to stay here, that is.

767
01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:07.540
How dare you say that?

768
01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:09.750
Where is he now?

769
01:05:10.330 --> 01:05:11.580
He's at a safe place.

770
01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:15.130
But he's probably not doing so well
because he's badly shot.

771
01:05:15.210 --> 01:05:16.670
Do you find this situation funny?

772
01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:18.260
Or, do you just joke about everything?

773
01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:21.390
If something bad happens to him,
and they blame you people for it,

774
01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:23.560
we'll be forced to go to war.

775
01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:26.470
Do you think
you'll still be able to crack jokes then?

776
01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:27.560
I know. I know that.

777
01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.810
I'm aware of the fact
that there will be war if he dies.

778
01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:33.520
I have two kids, for God's sake.
Of course I take this seriously.

779
01:05:35.650 --> 01:05:36.990
Calm down already.

780
01:05:37.490 --> 01:05:40.410
They can't operate on him
until his brain pressure goes down.

781
01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:45.410
Hang on. I need to check this.
What's he doing?

782
01:05:46.450 --> 01:05:48.660
Why is he stopped there?
We're in Uijeongbu.

783
01:05:49.290 --> 01:05:50.790
You said they would use a tunnel.

784
01:05:55.550 --> 01:05:57.130
You guys dug the tunnel all the way here?

785
01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:00.260
I don't know the exact locations.

786
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:04.510
Do people in the North eat moles
by any chance?

787
01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:09.850
No, we don't eat shit like that.
We eat rice and meat soup.

788
01:06:10.810 --> 01:06:13.940
Then, why are you people so good
at digging underground tunnels?

789
01:06:14.730 --> 01:06:17.360
You guys should dig all the subway tunnels
when we're reunified.

790
01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:26.950
He must be around here.

791
01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:31.960
UIJEONGBU ARMY STEW

792
01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:33.670
ARMY STEW WITH 35 YEARS OF HISTORY

793
01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:35.080
SPECIALIZED IN ARMY STEW

794
01:06:35.170 --> 01:06:36.840
You folks have built so many army bases

795
01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:38.510
to prepare for war.

796
01:06:38.590 --> 01:06:40.720
How many mess halls are there
in this area?

797
01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:42.300
Hey, you commie.

798
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:47.390
Those restaurants aren't mess halls.

799
01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:50.230
A dish called "army stew" was invented
back in the time

800
01:06:50.310 --> 01:06:53.770
when our dads and uncles
had to fight each other in the war.

801
01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:56.400
It was made with foods scrounged
from the US army bases.

802
01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:00.990
I knew it. You people built those
army bases with the Americans' help.

803
01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:05.530
Forget it. What do I even expect?

804
01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:12.290
Unbelievable.
What is wrong with those people?

805
01:07:12.370 --> 01:07:15.500
At a critical time like this?
They're such slackers.

806
01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:20.090
Goodness, I was wondering
why they stopped here. They had lunch.

807
01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:24.880
Commie, aren't you hungry?

808
01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:28.600
-No, I'm not.
-Let's grab a bite to eat, too.

809
01:07:31.470 --> 01:07:33.770
We'll act like we ran into them there
to sit in the meeting.

810
01:07:33.850 --> 01:07:35.940
We'll have to go back
if they see us here now.

811
01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:40.190
A restaurant I used to frequent back
when I was in the military is nearby.

812
01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:46.240
Let's go. Come on.
It's that restaurant over there.

813
01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:48.620
MANGHYANG NOODLES

814
01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:50.240
Gosh, I haven't been here for ages.

815
01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.130
What's wrong?

816
01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:10.140
Dig in.

817
01:08:41.170 --> 01:08:42.500
Give me your hand.

818
01:08:55.350 --> 01:08:56.520
We're a team, okay?

819
01:08:57.230 --> 01:08:58.390
We're working together.

820
01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:01.860
Move over.

821
01:09:31.090 --> 01:09:32.970
Excuse me.
Another bowl of noodle soup, please.

822
01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:35.810
Well, we should get dumplings, too.

823
01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:51.240
Jeez.

824
01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:56.950
You're inhaling the noodles.

825
01:10:02.250 --> 01:10:04.090
I haven't eaten anything
since I left Kaesong.

826
01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:07.670
Also...

827
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:14.050
That burger or whatever it's called.
You ate the whole thing, remember?

828
01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:18.100
I didn't say anything. Eat all you want.

829
01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:22.520
Eat up.

830
01:10:28.570 --> 01:10:30.200
They make good skinny noodles here.

831
01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:32.320
"Skinny noodles"? What is that?

832
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:34.700
Excuse me. We ordered dumplings, too.

833
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:40.460
That's called skinny noodles.

834
01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:42.750
Are you a defector, too?

835
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:45.540
He came down here only a little while ago.

836
01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:47.800
Where are all the customers?

837
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:50.090
Has everyone fled already?

838
01:10:50.670 --> 01:10:51.930
Shouldn't you head south too?

839
01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:55.890
Goodness, there will be no safe place
on this land if a war breaks out.

840
01:10:56.550 --> 01:11:00.810
I'm more worried about my family
in the North.

841
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:14.610
I'll uncuff you.

842
01:11:15.450 --> 01:11:16.780
Don't do anything stupid, okay?

843
01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:23.920
Give it to me.

844
01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:35.970
Hey, wait up.

845
01:11:39.810 --> 01:11:41.220
Oh, no. My scarf.

846
01:11:44.890 --> 01:11:47.610
My ex-wife gave it to me as a gift.

847
01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:52.400
Do you have a family?

848
01:11:52.490 --> 01:11:54.950
I noticed you left
that information blank on your statement.

849
01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:04.750
I have a 13-year-old girl

850
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:06.370
and a ten-year-old boy.

851
01:12:08.330 --> 01:12:10.880
And you've met my ex-wife.

852
01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:15.970
Why did you and that doctor get divorced?

853
01:12:16.050 --> 01:12:16.970
Goodness.

854
01:12:18.970 --> 01:12:20.510
Let's not talk about that, okay?

855
01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:22.640
Shall we put on some music?

856
01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:28.100
I have a wife
and an eight-year-old daughter.

857
01:12:32.150 --> 01:12:35.450
Do you know who G-Dragon is?
I heard that he's a singer.

858
01:12:35.530 --> 01:12:38.160
Of course I know who he is.
Everyone knows G-Dragon.

859
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.790
Have you been to the South
before as a spy?

860
01:12:49.170 --> 01:12:50.750
No, my daughter likes him.

861
01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:53.920
Girls love that guy.

862
01:12:54.010 --> 01:12:56.340
My daughter also has his songs
downloaded everywhere.

863
01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:58.050
This is his song. Check it out.

864
01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:15.490
Is this lousy music really world-famous?

865
01:13:15.570 --> 01:13:16.610
Did your daughter say that?

866
01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:20.280
Then, just believe her.
I can never win with my daughter either.

867
01:13:21.870 --> 01:13:26.540
<i>Enough of your sweet talks,
I'll misbehave myself tonight</i>

868
01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:28.290
<i>Leave me alone</i>

869
01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:31.500
<i>I was alone anyway</i>

870
01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:33.460
<i>There's no reason</i>

871
01:13:33.550 --> 01:13:35.510
<i>There's no sincerity</i>

872
01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:39.050
<i>Enough of your sweet talks</i>

873
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:57.610
Are you sure that's Tae-han Ri?

874
01:13:58.530 --> 01:14:00.700
Take a look.
I can't see a thing from here.

875
01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:14.090
I can't see well from here either.

876
01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:18.920
Call him now and tell him
that we're close by.

877
01:14:19.010 --> 01:14:21.760
We need him to invite us
in order to join them.

878
01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:24.100
Chief Park will flip
if we just show up now.

879
01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:37.780
I honestly can't see a thing.

880
01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.820
Wait, is that him?

881
01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:46.780
What just happened?

882
01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:48.160
What is going on?

883
01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:51.870
-Snipers!
-What?

884
01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:54.630
Stay calm.

885
01:15:01.670 --> 01:15:02.930
Kill them now.

886
01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:08.100
Hang-pil, I'm at the Office
of the former Worker's Party.

887
01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:09.220
Send troops here now.

888
01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:17.150
Get in. Hurry!

889
01:15:17.230 --> 01:15:18.650
Launch the next operation.

890
01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:03.440
Take this. I'm giving it to you
because I trust you.

891
01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:16.000
Now.

892
01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:52.490
Chief Ri!

893
01:16:55.250 --> 01:16:56.250
Chief Park.

894
01:16:58.370 --> 01:16:59.330
Chief Ri.

895
01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:15.310
Who are you?

896
01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:19.440
-Who are you...
<i>-Comrade Eom.</i>

897
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:22.770
<i>If you accomplish this mission,
you'll become a hero</i>

898
01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:25.280
who saved the country from a coup,
and your family will receive

899
01:17:25.530 --> 01:17:27.530
the respect and privilege
that come with it.

900
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:35.160
-What...
-What the hell is going on?

901
01:17:35.250 --> 01:17:36.540
-What did you do?
-Why is he here?

902
01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:37.910
What the fuck were you thinking?

903
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.460
It was our only chance to stop the war,
you son of a bitch!

904
01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:42.090
-Why is that commie here?
-What the fuck?

905
01:17:42.170 --> 01:17:43.460
What the hell have you done...

906
01:18:16.830 --> 01:18:18.200
Hands up! Don't move.

907
01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:21.170
I'm Cheol-u Kwak,
Senior Secretary for National Security.

908
01:18:21.250 --> 01:18:22.330
Call an ambulance!

909
01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:23.590
<i>So, you're saying...</i>

910
01:18:24.460 --> 01:18:27.460
the situation in the North
will get sorted out soon because

911
01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:30.430
the instigator of the coup,
Gwang-dong Park, is dead now.

912
01:18:30.510 --> 01:18:34.260
Is that what the guy who brought
Number One here said?

913
01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:37.100
-Yes, sir. That's correct.
-Where is he now?

914
01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:40.190
He fell unconscious because he lost
too much blood. He's being treated now.

915
01:18:40.270 --> 01:18:41.100
Is that so?

916
01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:48.360
National Security Chief Byeong-jin Park
was recording this

917
01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:50.200
until the moment he died.

918
01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:53.200
<i>How's our leader?</i>

919
01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:56.200
<i>He's being treated at the moment.
Let's gauge the situation first.</i>

920
01:18:56.410 --> 01:18:58.750
<i>A few traitors in our army
instigated a coup.</i>

921
01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:02.290
<i>I have full control over Pyongyang,
our nukes, and the strategic forces,</i>

922
01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:04.000
<i>so please don't worry.</i>

923
01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:05.500
<i>If you send our leader back to us,</i>

924
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:09.340
<i>we'll eliminate the traitors
and retract the declaration...</i>

925
01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:13.760
They've always been like this.

926
01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:15.600
They told us that they wanted to talk,

927
01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:17.600
while they attacked
and sank our Cheonan warship.

928
01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:20.180
Those scoundrels bombed
Yeonpyeong Island, for God's sake.

929
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:23.440
What we know for certain
is that they have declared war on us

930
01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:25.440
and that they have nuclear weapons.

931
01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:26.900
There's one more thing, sir.

932
01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:30.030
We have their leader, sir.

933
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:31.280
We also know that

934
01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:35.160
some of them are trying their best
to prevent the war and sort out the mess.

935
01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:36.780
I do not trust them.

936
01:19:37.490 --> 01:19:40.450
I would much rather talk with our allies
who have been in this with us.

937
01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:43.410
So, are you saying you'll push ahead
with the preemptive nuclear attack?

938
01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:46.670
Then, what do you want to do? Will you
endanger the lives of 50 million people

939
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:49.210
for a 50% chance?

940
01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:52.420
Let's say we can worry about the cost
of war and post-war restoration later.

941
01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:53.630
If we bomb them...

942
01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:56.850
Do you think North Koreans
will see us as compatriots

943
01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:59.470
after we drop nuclear bombs on them?

944
01:20:03.230 --> 01:20:04.940
Could you please give us some privacy?

945
01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:11.150
Gyeong-yeong, let's be honest now.

946
01:20:12.190 --> 01:20:13.950
A coup has broken out in the North.

947
01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:16.820
They have no means to fight back
even if we attack them now.

948
01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:19.330
Have we ever had a better reason
and chance to permanently

949
01:20:19.410 --> 01:20:21.830
eliminate the threat of war
from this peninsula?

950
01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:25.870
Missing this golden opportunity
is like doing an injustice to our country.

951
01:20:28.290 --> 01:20:31.460
Gyeong-yeong, please let me do this
before I leave office.

952
01:20:31.550 --> 01:20:34.130
Allow me to present this incredible gift
to our people

953
01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:36.430
and to you,
the next president of this country.

954
01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:38.220
Let me have my way this time.

955
01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:42.020
Both our economy
and population growth rates

956
01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:43.980
are going down at the moment.

957
01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:45.730
Shall I put it in simpler terms?

958
01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:47.770
This country is going bust.

959
01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:52.230
The two Koreas must be reunited.
If you can't understand why,

960
01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:54.940
try to think about reunification
from economic standpoint at least.

961
01:20:56.150 --> 01:20:58.320
I absolutely cannot agree
to a preemptive nuclear strike.

962
01:20:59.870 --> 01:21:00.700
I'm glad...

963
01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:04.290
that this is happening
during my presidency.

964
01:21:04.370 --> 01:21:05.460
It's truly unfortunate that

965
01:21:06.370 --> 01:21:09.790
someone with no historical consciousness
is still the president.

966
01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:29.560
-Excuse me. Mr. Kwak?
-Yes.

967
01:21:30.730 --> 01:21:33.360
-Are you Mr. Cheol-u Eom's guardian?
-Yes, I am.

968
01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:37.820
From his chest X-ray, we discovered
that he has metastatic lung cancer.

969
01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.200
We also did a CT scan on his abdomen

970
01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:42.830
and found out that he has
stage four pancreatic cancer as well.

971
01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:45.870
The cancer has already spread
to his spine,

972
01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:48.080
so he could experience
neurogenic shock, too.

973
01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:51.130
To be honest, he could die any minute.

974
01:21:53.710 --> 01:21:57.130
<i>Do you think that</i>

975
01:21:57.880 --> 01:21:59.010
<i>he's aware of his condition?</i>

976
01:22:00.010 --> 01:22:01.430
<i>I'm sure he does.</i>

977
01:22:01.970 --> 01:22:03.560
<i>He must have been in extreme pain.</i>

978
01:22:07.310 --> 01:22:08.230
Hey.

979
01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:10.480
Gosh.

980
01:22:12.610 --> 01:22:13.650
How are you feeling?

981
01:22:15.190 --> 01:22:17.530
-I'm feeling good.
-Great.

982
01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:19.450
I slept well for a change.

983
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:25.490
How's the bullet wound?
It must hurt a lot.

984
01:22:26.450 --> 01:22:28.620
They must have given me
a ton of analgesic injections.

985
01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:31.500
I don't feel any pain.

986
01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.040
That's good.

987
01:22:39.970 --> 01:22:41.130
I'm glad to hear that, but...

988
01:22:42.890 --> 01:22:43.930
But...

989
01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:49.270
Why did you kill Gwang-dong Park?

990
01:22:49.770 --> 01:22:51.640
That was my mission.

991
01:22:53.150 --> 01:22:55.820
I was told to kill him
because he's the instigator of the coup.

992
01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:59.070
That's why you killed him?

993
01:22:59.150 --> 01:23:00.950
Don't you think it's weird though?

994
01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:05.450
It must have taken him a lot to start
the coup. It was about to succeed,

995
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:09.000
but he risked his life
and came down here himself.

996
01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:11.500
What are you trying to get at?

997
01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:15.170
It just doesn't add up.

998
01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:20.090
Also, coups are usually started
by those in the military.

999
01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:22.840
I heard that one of your former presidents
was assassinated

1000
01:23:23.050 --> 01:23:24.970
by the KCIA director,
not by a military official.

1001
01:23:25.050 --> 01:23:30.310
Right, but those in the military
did start the coup later.

1002
01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:31.560
That's what happened here.

1003
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:35.150
Hello, Mr. Ri.

1004
01:23:36.110 --> 01:23:38.780
Yes. All right.

1005
01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:42.650
I have to step out.
Try to get some rest, okay?

1006
01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:48.830
<i>My fellow citizens, nationwide martial law</i>

1007
01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:51.410
<i>was declared at 6:00 a.m. today.</i>

1008
01:23:51.870 --> 01:23:57.040
<i>Starting today, a mandatory curfew will be
in effect from midnight to 5:00 a.m.</i>

1009
01:23:57.130 --> 01:24:00.260
<i>Please return home as soon as possible.</i>

1010
01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:06.180
-Are you going somewhere?
-Yes.

1011
01:24:06.890 --> 01:24:10.060
I'm going back to China.
I've been told to leave Korea immediately.

1012
01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:13.640
Since the situation is urgent,

1013
01:24:13.730 --> 01:24:16.020
let's exchange some information
to help each other out.

1014
01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:19.150
How's Number One doing?

1015
01:24:19.230 --> 01:24:20.480
It's 50-50.

1016
01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:24.530
Whom is China supporting as a leader
of the DPRK at the moment?

1017
01:24:24.610 --> 01:24:29.240
We have no choice but to support
the one who has most power over there.

1018
01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:33.410
It sounds like you leaked the information
that Number One is here

1019
01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:36.420
to the rebels as well as
to those who are trying to stop them.

1020
01:24:38.330 --> 01:24:40.210
If I had known,
I wouldn't have let it happen.

1021
01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:43.340
It looks like the higher-ups did it
whether it was a mistake or not.

1022
01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:44.800
The coup was...

1023
01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:47.760
started by the military, wasn't it?

1024
01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:52.220
Number One has killed hundreds
of generals since he came into power.

1025
01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:57.480
Also, he practically has sole control
over their nuclear weapons as well.

1026
01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:00.270
Then, who do you think it is?

1027
01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:03.940
If we bomb them,
will China think of us as their enemy?

1028
01:25:04.530 --> 01:25:05.990
What information can you give me?

1029
01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:08.110
Gwang-dong Park died
when he came down here.

1030
01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:10.450
That I know.

1031
01:25:10.530 --> 01:25:13.200
The current president does not want
to expand north after the strike.

1032
01:25:13.290 --> 01:25:14.830
I guess the next president will.

1033
01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:18.920
He won't be able to
if it's a nuclear strike.

1034
01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:21.170
We, Koreans,

1035
01:25:22.050 --> 01:25:25.260
will have no choice but to be dragged
into the cold war system once again.

1036
01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:28.840
You're Korean too.

1037
01:25:28.930 --> 01:25:29.760
So what?

1038
01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:33.470
Since when did you Korean people
treat us as brothers?

1039
01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:37.060
Don't you folks only consider
the rich ones as your brothers?

1040
01:25:37.890 --> 01:25:40.020
Ethnically, I am Korean,

1041
01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:42.150
but I consider myself 100% Chinese.

1042
01:25:42.230 --> 01:25:45.740
My country has been maintaining
a consistent stance on this matter.

1043
01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:47.740
We will absolutely not allow the US

1044
01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:51.410
or any of their military allies
to share our borders with us.

1045
01:25:52.410 --> 01:25:55.700
If the DPRK is destroyed by nukes,
we'll have to take their people in.

1046
01:25:55.790 --> 01:25:59.830
Let me give you
one last piece of information.

1047
01:26:01.210 --> 01:26:04.130
China doesn't like that idea.

1048
01:26:04.710 --> 01:26:06.170
If we take their people in,

1049
01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:08.590
our power will be dispersed.

1050
01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:13.510
That's precisely what the American
and Japanese people want.

1051
01:26:25.530 --> 01:26:27.900
Hello. Good evening, Mr. Takashi.

1052
01:26:28.570 --> 01:26:29.780
Hello, Mr. Ri.

1053
01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:31.910
Are you here to depart as well?

1054
01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:35.330
Shall I introduce you two?

1055
01:26:35.910 --> 01:26:36.740
Mr. Kwak.

1056
01:26:37.410 --> 01:26:41.000
This is Mr. Sakai Takashi
from the CIRO in Japan.

1057
01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:44.250
We've known each other for years.

1058
01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:46.420
What's Number One's condition?

1059
01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:47.760
I hear it's 50-50.

1060
01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:49.470
Thank you.

1061
01:27:00.810 --> 01:27:02.480
If you think of me as a fellow Korean,

1062
01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:05.690
I'll give you a word of advice.

1063
01:27:08.530 --> 01:27:11.450
Do not let this war break out.

1064
01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:15.870
Escort Mr. Kwak home.

1065
01:27:21.870 --> 01:27:25.670
What about the faculty chair position
at Peking University? Will you do it?

1066
01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:42.640
Jeez, I'm so popular today.

1067
01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:50.900
See? Look at all the crap
everyone has to do

1068
01:27:50.990 --> 01:27:52.900
because you people split up this country.

1069
01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:10.380
Why should I do this?

1070
01:28:14.930 --> 01:28:16.850
Face up to reality for what?

1071
01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:50.840
Hey, Hang-pil. It's me.
Is everything okay?

1072
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:53.760
Do you know if they have decided
to bomb the North?

1073
01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:56.220
-See if you can gather some intel.
-Yes.

1074
01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:58.720
<i>The Tag Heuer smart watch
you wanted me to check...</i>

1075
01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:01.430
-Yes.
-Digital Forensics from the NIS called.

1076
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:02.810
<i>It's not just a watch.</i>

1077
01:29:02.930 --> 01:29:04.850
<i>They haven't been able
to crack the firewall yet,</i>

1078
01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:06.350
<i>but it can generate codes.</i>

1079
01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:07.650
It can generate codes?

1080
01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:13.440
A call from the president, sir.
He's on line one.

1081
01:29:15.490 --> 01:29:18.410
<i>NOW WHAT BELONGS TOGETHER
WILL GROW TOGETHER</i>

1082
01:29:18.490 --> 01:29:19.820
Hello, Mr. President.

1083
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:21.830
I'm calling to inform you

1084
01:29:21.910 --> 01:29:24.910
that I have agreed to the nuclear strike
on the North as the president.

1085
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:25.870
Mr. President.

1086
01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.710
<i>The war will begin and end during my term.</i>

1087
01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:30.960
<i>-Sir.</i>
-I'll take full responsibility.

1088
01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:31.920
<i>Sir!</i>

1089
01:29:44.930 --> 01:29:48.900
The Chinese and Japanese are already
calling their people back.

1090
01:29:54.820 --> 01:29:55.990
Even the US

1091
01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:59.200
isn't sure if we can pull off
this operation on the North.

1092
01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:08.670
MINOT AIR FORCE BASE

1093
01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:13.550
MERRY CHRISTMAS

1094
01:30:13.630 --> 01:30:15.590
THINGS TO FOLLOW UNDER THE MARTIAL LAW

1095
01:30:15.670 --> 01:30:18.510
REFRAIN YOURSELF FROM GOING OUT
UNLESS YOU FALL INTO ONE OF THE CATEGORIES

1096
01:30:22.510 --> 01:30:25.470
The rest of the world is thrown
into panic,

1097
01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:29.690
and yet, we have time for a cup of coffee.

1098
01:30:29.770 --> 01:30:31.810
This is one hell of a nation, isn't it?

1099
01:30:33.150 --> 01:30:34.150
May I?

1100
01:31:12.690 --> 01:31:15.060
All I can do is just pray

1101
01:31:15.150 --> 01:31:19.860
that your people will eliminate
the counterattack ability of the North

1102
01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:21.530
or that...

1103
01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:26.330
they'll retract their declaration of war.

1104
01:31:38.210 --> 01:31:40.880
I heard that Gwang-dong Park
has joined hands with Cheol-min Choi.

1105
01:31:41.050 --> 01:31:42.050
Cheol-min Choi?

1106
01:31:42.510 --> 01:31:44.970
I also found out that he was the one
who leaked our coordinates.

1107
01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:46.640
We should get rid of him right away.

1108
01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:49.470
Don't bother.
Pyongyang is our priority now.

1109
01:31:50.230 --> 01:31:54.350
As soon as we get into Pyongyang
and declare ourselves as the new leaders,

1110
01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:57.020
he'll probably take his own life.
Just leave him be.

1111
01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:18.460
What are you waiting for?
Will you shoot me or not?

1112
01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:22.300
Soldiers mustn't be that indecisive.

1113
01:32:24.970 --> 01:32:26.180
Do you have something to say?

1114
01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:28.430
I just guarded Pyongyang
as per the command I received.

1115
01:32:28.510 --> 01:32:30.600
From whom? That's what matters.

1116
01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:34.890
Where's the detonator?

1117
01:32:37.980 --> 01:32:39.150
The code generator.

1118
01:32:43.190 --> 01:32:44.530
There should be two.

1119
01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:48.280
The leader keeps
the other one on him at all times.

1120
01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:55.500
Are you saying
retracting the declaration of war

1121
01:32:56.330 --> 01:32:57.830
can stop the nuclear strike?

1122
01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:00.090
Our priority is getting them
to retract it at all costs.

1123
01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.960
Without that,
we can't even try to stop it.

1124
01:33:09.890 --> 01:33:10.810
Give me my phone.

1125
01:33:16.690 --> 01:33:19.520
You have many missed calls. Is Tae-han Ri
number one on your speed dial?

1126
01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:33.950
Chief. It's me, Cheol-u.

1127
01:33:34.370 --> 01:33:36.160
American nuclear bombers
are on their way now.

1128
01:33:36.250 --> 01:33:37.500
If we retract the declaration...

1129
01:33:40.290 --> 01:33:41.250
Pardon?

1130
01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:46.550
Yes.

1131
01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:50.850
I'm at a hospital now.

1132
01:33:52.430 --> 01:33:54.720
Guards? Just one now, sir.

1133
01:33:57.730 --> 01:33:58.600
A watch?

1134
01:34:01.230 --> 01:34:02.480
What kind of watch?

1135
01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:07.700
Yes, I remember.
The Leader was wearing it.

1136
01:34:13.330 --> 01:34:15.700
No, I don't have it,
but I know where it is.

1137
01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:26.550
Then, whom should I meet and where?

1138
01:34:31.260 --> 01:34:32.350
Okay. Got it, sir.

1139
01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:42.900
Call in the hackers.

1140
01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:44.650
What's wrong? What did he say?

1141
01:34:46.610 --> 01:34:49.110
He said he already heard
about the nuclear strike plan from China.

1142
01:34:50.990 --> 01:34:53.660
He also said that they were going
to retract the declaration anyway.

1143
01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:57.500
Oh, I see.

1144
01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:01.710
By the way,

1145
01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:05.420
why did he ask you about a watch?
And whom are you meeting?

1146
01:35:09.010 --> 01:35:11.260
He was talking about our leader's watch.

1147
01:35:12.180 --> 01:35:14.680
He wants me
to return to the North with it.

1148
01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:17.020
That watch.

1149
01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:20.640
It's a code generator
for nuclear missiles.

1150
01:35:21.850 --> 01:35:22.690
Did you know that?

1151
01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:40.040
All the sanctions against us...

1152
01:35:42.210 --> 01:35:44.670
made this attitude spread in our army.

1153
01:35:47.630 --> 01:35:49.550
"Using the nukes will kill us...

1154
01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:54.720
but maybe it's better to use it if we're
all going to starve to death anyway."

1155
01:35:56.010 --> 01:35:58.680
Hence, the military devised
a last-resort strategy.

1156
01:35:59.970 --> 01:36:02.190
They decided to use Seoul
and the US Armed Forces in Korea

1157
01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:04.850
if they can't use the nukes
to negotiate with the world.

1158
01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:06.360
What does that mean?

1159
01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:11.610
If we set off a nuclear rocket
over Daejeon,

1160
01:36:11.690 --> 01:36:12.610
STRIKE PLAN ON SOUTH KOREA

1161
01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:15.570
<i>all communication equipment
in the South will burn,</i>

1162
01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:18.620
<i>and all of your cutting-edge weapons
will be turned into scrap metal.</i>

1163
01:36:19.410 --> 01:36:22.620
<i>While that's going on, 250,000 soldiers
from our special forces will seize Seoul</i>

1164
01:36:22.710 --> 01:36:24.170
<i>and capture US soldiers.</i>

1165
01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:28.500
<i>Then, the US will have no choice
but to negotiate with us.</i>

1166
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.550
Our military thought
that it's the only way...

1167
01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:35.180
to protect our country.

1168
01:36:37.390 --> 01:36:38.220
But...

1169
01:36:39.470 --> 01:36:41.890
our leader didn't implement the strategy,

1170
01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:45.190
and some military authorities grumbled.

1171
01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:50.110
They criticized him and said that...

1172
01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:53.240
he, like his predecessors,
intends to use the nukes

1173
01:36:54.030 --> 01:36:56.240
to maintain his power
and not for the Republic.

1174
01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:01.870
There's this saying.

1175
01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:07.170
"People of a divided nation suffer more

1176
01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.090
from those who use the division
for their political gain...

1177
01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:13.970
than the division itself."

1178
01:37:20.260 --> 01:37:21.930
Telling me to bring the watch...

1179
01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:27.350
It means that he'll carry out the plan.

1180
01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:30.940
How long will it take?

1181
01:37:31.020 --> 01:37:33.110
I'll have a better idea in a bit, but...

1182
01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:35.450
I guess about three months?

1183
01:37:42.580 --> 01:37:44.290
How old are you?

1184
01:37:45.290 --> 01:37:47.960
-I'm 19 years old, sir.
-You're 19?

1185
01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:52.250
I see. Maybe you're too young to know.

1186
01:37:53.130 --> 01:37:54.510
I'll explain.

1187
01:37:55.220 --> 01:37:56.170
Attention!

1188
01:37:58.930 --> 01:38:03.140
Two decades ago,
three million people died on this land.

1189
01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:06.140
How? They died of starvation.

1190
01:38:07.730 --> 01:38:11.230
But you know what? That did not stop us

1191
01:38:11.610 --> 01:38:13.570
from making the nuclear rockets.

1192
01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:17.610
Now, they're all ready to be launched.

1193
01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:20.740
If you guys can't break the codes,

1194
01:38:20.950 --> 01:38:23.990
it means that the nukes
are basically useless.

1195
01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:26.330
How ridiculous is that?

1196
01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:32.880
If I were one of those American bastards,
I would never miss this opportunity.

1197
01:38:34.210 --> 01:38:35.050
Three months?

1198
01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:36.590
All right.

1199
01:38:37.340 --> 01:38:40.010
The Americans will kill you anyway,
so you should just die now.

1200
01:38:40.090 --> 01:38:43.390
Cracking the entire system
will take about three months,

1201
01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:48.020
but if I tackle each digit at a time,
I should be able to do it in a week, sir.

1202
01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:49.100
I'll give you one day.

1203
01:38:50.190 --> 01:38:51.230
Yes, sir.

1204
01:39:44.030 --> 01:39:45.120
China is fuming.

1205
01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:48.660
They want us to retract the declaration
as the nuclear bombers are on their way.

1206
01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.540
It'll be announced soon.

1207
01:39:53.250 --> 01:39:54.170
And...

1208
01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:57.500
We now know where it is,

1209
01:39:58.710 --> 01:39:59.710
so send our guys there.

1210
01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:06.810
Salute. May I see some ID, please?

1211
01:40:06.890 --> 01:40:08.970
-We're from Security Service.
-Open the gates!

1212
01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:22.530
-Attention.
-Salute!

1213
01:40:22.610 --> 01:40:23.450
At ease.

1214
01:40:29.830 --> 01:40:31.870
ARMED FORCES CAPITAL HOSPITAL

1215
01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:38.340
<i>The Supreme Command of
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea</i>

1216

1220
01:41:23.090 --> 01:41:24.510
We presume that it's North Korea.

1221
01:41:24.630 --> 01:41:26.840
Please stay in the bunker
until the situation clears.

1222
01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:30.010
Team One and Two, to the Blue House.
Get in!

1223
01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:30.930
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

1224
01:41:32.020 --> 01:41:33.850
What? The Blue House was attacked?

1225
01:41:35.140 --> 01:41:36.310
By who? How bad is it?

1226
01:41:37.940 --> 01:41:38.810
You don't know?

1227
01:41:39.980 --> 01:41:42.360
It's a decoy.
This hospital is their real target.

1228
01:41:47.110 --> 01:41:48.320
Get ready.

1229
01:41:49.450 --> 01:41:51.120
Stop! Stop right there!

1230
01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:52.830
-What's going on?
-It's an emergency.

1231
01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:55.080
Only authorized personnel can go in now.

1232
01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:57.500
He's injured badly.
He'll die if he's not treated right away.

1233
01:41:58.540 --> 01:42:00.460
-Corporal Kim, go check.
-Yes, sir.

-Please move him and finish the surgery.
-Yes, sir.

1249

I'm from National Security.

1250
01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:45.890
He's with us! He's been working with us.
It's okay.

1251
01:47:46.890 --> 01:47:47.720
Are you all right?

1252
01:47:49.140 --> 01:47:50.190
Where's our leader?

1253
01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:53.020
He's being moved to another hospital.

1254

<i>Confirmed dead...</i>

1255

Sit down.

1256
01:48:13.540 --> 01:48:16.710
This shows that they're determined
to start the war no matter what.

1257
01:48:18.090 --> 01:48:19.340
Use me as bait.

1258
01:48:19.420 --> 01:48:21.090
I'll go meet with Tae-han Ri.

1259
01:48:21.170 --> 01:48:23.430
Put a location tracker on the watch
and give it to me.

1260
01:48:24.090 --> 01:48:27.220
Then, bomb my location.

1261
01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:36.820
Sir, we have accessed the first one.

1262
01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:43.360
Prepare to launch it.

1263
01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:03.970
China says that the information they're
about to give us might put them at risk

1264
01:49:04.970 --> 01:49:07.850
of exposing their intelligence network
and their top-notch technologies

1265
01:49:07.970 --> 01:49:09.600
which took them 20 years to build.

1266
01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:12.430
They would like us
to remember their kindness

1267
01:49:13.060 --> 01:49:14.480
and our blood alliance with them.

1268
01:49:16.020 --> 01:49:20.940
They're obviously doing it to humiliate
the US through us. How obnoxious.

1269
01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:23.190
Give me that.

1270
01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:26.870
Deliver this message.

1271
01:49:27.870 --> 01:49:31.580
North Korea and China
are brothers that have been

1272
01:49:31.660 --> 01:49:34.870
fighting against Japan
and the US together...

1273
01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:40.300
and we will always remain brothers.

1274
01:49:41.170 --> 01:49:44.510
North Korea will never forget this favor.

1275
01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:03.990
AIRSPACE OVER HOKKAIDO, JAPAN

1276

HEILONGJIANG, CHINA
X-BAND RADAR BASE

1277

AWACS AIRCRAFT OVER THE EAST SEA

1278
01:50:15.210 --> 01:50:18.540
JAPANESE AEGIS-EQUIPPED WARSHIP
ON THE EAST SEA

1279
01:50:41.770 --> 01:50:43.610
The missiles have entered the East Sea.

1280
01:50:43.690 --> 01:50:46.190
-They'll give us the coordinates.
-Change the coordinates.

1281
01:50:46.690 --> 01:50:50.990
Sir, this isn't Daejeon.
It's in the middle of the sea.

1282
01:50:51.070 --> 01:50:55.370
The American bastards
fired nuclear missiles at our republic!

1283
01:50:55.450 --> 01:50:56.750
Launch it immediately!

1284
01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:19.850
Yes, sir. Prepare to intercept.

1285
01:51:20.980 --> 01:51:22.440
Prepared to intercept!

1286
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:24.610
-Fire.
-Fire!

1287
01:52:27.460 --> 01:52:29.590
Quiet. Be quiet!

1288
01:52:31.470 --> 01:52:32.880
Get back to work now.

1289
01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:39.430
Announce the following
on Central Television.

1290
01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:43.350
"Today, we utterly crushed

1291
01:52:43.770 --> 01:52:47.520
the American invaders'
wicked plan to annihilate us."

1292
01:52:47.610 --> 01:52:50.400
<i>We witnessed the proof
of what can happen to our country</i>

1293
01:52:50.490 --> 01:52:52.610
<i>without our nuclear weapons.</i>

1294
01:52:52.820 --> 01:52:55.950
<i>Our nuclear weapons are for self-defense,
not for offense.</i>

1295
01:52:56.370 --> 01:53:00.410
<i>However,
if they dare to attack us once again,</i>

1296
01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:03.000
-Yes, Mr. Prime Minister.
<i>-we'll fire all the nuclear rockets</i>

1297
01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:06.170
<i>at Japan and punish them
for helping the US</i>

1298
01:53:06.250 --> 01:53:07.380
-Yes, sir.
<i>-by...</i>

1299
01:53:07.460 --> 01:53:09.960
<i>making sure they're
wiped off the face of the earth for good.</i>

1300
01:53:10.050 --> 01:53:12.470
But why at Japan, sir?

1301
01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:18.560
The Americans listen to the Japanese
more than us, you know.

1302
01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:20.560
Yes, sir.

1303
01:53:28.150 --> 01:53:31.860
A North Korean nuclear missile
just exploded over the East Sea.

1304
01:53:36.490 --> 01:53:37.910
They probably hacked one.

1305
01:53:38.070 --> 01:53:40.450
South Korea will be the next target
if they hack another code.

1306
01:53:40.540 --> 01:53:42.160
Listen, Comrade Kwak.

1307
01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:45.620
Leak false information
that the leader is dead.

1308
01:53:46.210 --> 01:53:47.960
If they think
their assassination plan worked,

1309
01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:51.000
it'll buy us some time.

1310
01:53:52.420 --> 01:53:53.420
Comrade, please.

1311
01:53:54.800 --> 01:53:58.140
The longer I stay here,
the more dangerous it will get.

1312
01:54:00.260 --> 01:54:02.270
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

1313
01:54:12.230 --> 01:54:13.860
Number One died.

1314
01:54:32.420 --> 01:54:35.380
-Hey, what's going on? Did he really die?
-No, he didn't.

1315
01:54:35.470 --> 01:54:38.300
We moved him to another hospital.
He'll undergo surgery soon.

1316
01:54:41.810 --> 01:54:43.310
Everyone here is going nuts.

1317
01:54:43.890 --> 01:54:45.930
The president requested another strike
on the North,

1318
01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:47.690
but the US won't do it.

1319
01:55:04.830 --> 01:55:07.500
You know that they fired the missile
after the retraction.

1320
01:55:07.660 --> 01:55:09.290
How can you spew such nonsense now?

1321
01:55:09.670 --> 01:55:13.750
Is our alliance worth nothing
compared to your relationship with Japan?

1322
01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:31.650
Do you think...

1323
01:55:32.860 --> 01:55:36.190
that bombing North Korea can destroy
all of their nuclear weapons?

1324
01:55:38.150 --> 01:55:39.530
Even if they manage to launch...

1325
01:55:40.610 --> 01:55:42.370
just one of them...

1326
01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:51.670
The two of you never gave me permission.

1327
01:55:51.750 --> 01:55:53.420
I'll take full responsibility.

1328
01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:57.420
No, you have my permission.

1329
01:55:57.510 --> 01:55:59.630
Let's try everything we can do.

1330
01:56:07.390 --> 01:56:08.430
Are you feeling better?

1331
01:56:13.610 --> 01:56:16.150
It looks like you're fully recovered.

1332
01:56:19.940 --> 01:56:21.450
Do you mind stepping out for a minute?

1333
01:56:26.530 --> 01:56:30.160
They removed the code generator
and installed a tracker on it.

1334
01:56:30.250 --> 01:56:32.460
I heard it can detect signals
from up to 200m underground.

1335
01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:34.500
It's made of some radioactive material.

1336
01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:36.710
You see this red button, right?

1337
01:56:37.460 --> 01:56:40.920
Pressing the button will reset the system.

1338
01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:43.840
When we see that,
we'll know that you're there.

1339
01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:50.390
Wearing it all the time
isn't good for you. Give me that.

1340
01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:52.520
Thanks for your concern.

1341
01:56:55.150 --> 01:56:56.110
But why?

1342
01:56:58.650 --> 01:57:00.650
Because I might die from the radiation?

1343
01:57:03.610 --> 01:57:06.700
No, I'm worried about myself.
I don't want to die from the radiation.

1344
01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:11.040
Hey, wait.

1345
01:57:13.210 --> 01:57:14.790
-Wear this.
-I don't need it.

1346
01:57:15.670 --> 01:57:19.210
You're in South Korea. Do you want
to advertise that you're a commie?

1347
01:57:20.710 --> 01:57:21.590
Here.

1348
01:57:37.730 --> 01:57:41.230
Hey, Cheol-u.
So, what does your name mean?

1349
01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:47.490
It means "strong friendship."

1350
01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:53.580
You said yours means
"bright world," right?

1351
01:57:54.910 --> 01:57:56.170
Great memory.

1352
01:57:56.250 --> 01:57:58.670
I didn't think you were listening
because you were in pain.

1353
01:58:02.710 --> 01:58:05.590
Hey, tell me a funny story or something.

1354
01:58:06.090 --> 01:58:07.640
I don't know any stories.

1355
01:58:08.140 --> 01:58:10.010
So, I have to lighten up the mood?

1356
01:58:13.220 --> 01:58:16.060
What does a king do when
he doesn't want to return to his palace?

1357
01:58:18.230 --> 01:58:19.480
How would I know?

1358
01:58:23.650 --> 01:58:25.990
He grunts and grumbles.

1359
01:58:30.990 --> 01:58:36.830
What's the name of the town in Seoul
where chubby people live?

1360
01:58:37.290 --> 01:58:38.670
Is there actually a town like that?

1361
01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:43.340
Banpo-dong.
"Banpo" sounds like "chubby," you know.

1362
01:58:46.470 --> 01:58:52.390
Then, what's the name of the town
where fat people live?

1363
01:58:56.430 --> 01:58:57.310
Gaepo-dong.

1364
01:58:57.440 --> 01:58:59.980
Wow, how did you know? I'm impressed.

1365
01:59:01.610 --> 01:59:03.320
You've been here as a spy, haven't you?

1366
01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:06.400
Do they still reward
those who report spies?

1367
01:59:06.860 --> 01:59:10.490
Well, I have watched
the famous comedy show a few times.

1368
01:59:11.280 --> 01:59:13.280
Goodness, you little...

1369
01:59:13.830 --> 01:59:17.210
You scold your daughter
for listening to South Korean music,

1370
01:59:17.710 --> 01:59:19.080
while you watch all the fun stuff.

1371
01:59:26.130 --> 01:59:27.130
Comrade Eom.

1372
01:59:27.840 --> 01:59:29.050
What? Comrade Kwak.

1373
01:59:33.350 --> 01:59:34.970
You have to make it out
in one piece, okay?

1374
01:59:41.730 --> 01:59:43.110
And put on some weight, will you?

1375
01:59:44.190 --> 01:59:45.150
I'll lose some.

1376
01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:50.910
That way,
we can live in Banpo-dong together.

1377
01:59:53.280 --> 01:59:55.160
We'll drink soju together
from time to time.

1378
02:00:02.330 --> 02:00:06.300
By the way, what on earth
is G-Dragon saying in his song?

1379
02:00:09.340 --> 02:00:10.590
I'm not sure either.

1380
02:00:40.460 --> 02:00:41.660
Here you go.

1381
02:00:52.590 --> 02:00:53.680
May I borrow that?

1382
02:00:56.430 --> 02:00:57.260
My credit card?

1383
02:00:58.260 --> 02:00:59.890
I probably won't be able to pay you back.

1384
02:01:01.180 --> 02:01:02.310
Can you let me use it?

1385
02:01:17.700 --> 02:01:18.740
Thanks a lot.

1386
02:01:46.270 --> 02:01:48.360
This is the address you gave me.

1387
02:02:09.130 --> 02:02:10.170
I'll be going, then.

1388
02:02:12.050 --> 02:02:15.550
Are you sure this is the right place?
What if it isn't?

1389
02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:16.800
I think this is it.

1390
02:02:18.090 --> 02:02:20.430
I'll wait for you here just in case.

1391
02:02:21.720 --> 02:02:24.430
No, let's just part ways here.

1392
02:02:31.860 --> 02:02:34.150
Damn, what a coldhearted commie.

1393
02:02:37.700 --> 02:02:39.820
What is it?
Did we come to the wrong place?

1394
02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:41.330
Cheol-u.

1395
02:02:41.410 --> 02:02:45.580
Gosh, it feels so weird to hear you
saying my name.

1396
02:02:48.040 --> 02:02:51.460
If everything goes well,
please send the girl back to the North.

1397
02:02:52.590 --> 02:02:54.090
Her family must be waiting for her.

1398
02:02:55.220 --> 02:02:56.760
Of course, I will.

1399
02:02:57.590 --> 02:03:01.100
You should be good to your family, too.
Reconcile with your ex-wife.

1400
02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:04.430
-She seemed like a very good person.
-I know that.

1401
02:03:05.430 --> 02:03:07.270
Hey, you forgot your stuff in the car.

1402
02:03:08.560 --> 02:03:09.650
Cheol-u.

1403
02:03:10.610 --> 02:03:11.520
Yes.

1404
02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:13.270
Those things...

1405
02:03:15.150 --> 02:03:16.780
If all goes well...

1406
02:03:18.860 --> 02:03:19.740
and...

1407
02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:23.870
if travel is allowed
between the two Koreas.

1408
02:03:24.910 --> 02:03:25.870
Please send them...

1409
02:03:28.210 --> 02:03:29.830
to this address.

1410
02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:36.760
21-3 Chollima Pyongsong North Pyongan
Ji-hye Kang and In-yeong Eom

1411
02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:39.010
The pale pink one is for my daughter,

1412
02:03:39.090 --> 02:03:40.640
and the navy one is for my wife.

1413
02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:50.310
Thank you for everything, Cheol-u.

1414
02:04:13.710 --> 02:04:15.000
Cheol-u from the North!

1415
02:04:17.380 --> 02:04:18.380
Goodbye.

1416
02:04:20.300 --> 02:04:21.340
Take care of yourself.

1417
02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:31.600
I'm sorry.

1418
02:05:20.530 --> 02:05:22.900
-Are you Comrade Eom?
-Yes.

1419
02:05:24.660 --> 02:05:26.200
I'm glad you made it back safely.

1420
02:06:26.760 --> 02:06:27.720
<i>At the moment,</i>

1421
02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:31.930
the chief director of the RGB, Tae-han Ri,
is the real power-holder in North Korea.

1422
02:06:32.020 --> 02:06:35.020
We suspect that he and his men
must be directing everything

1423
02:06:35.100 --> 02:06:37.100
in a secret underground bunker somewhere,

1424
02:06:37.190 --> 02:06:39.560
but the exact location is unknown
at the moment.

THE GREAT DPRK

1426
02:06:41.940 --> 02:06:44.570
<i>A North Korean named Cheol-u Eom</i>

1427
02:06:45.650 --> 02:06:47.320
<i>brought Number One down here</i>

1428
02:06:48.450 --> 02:06:51.030
<i>during the Kaesong
Industrial Complex incident</i>

1429
02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:53.200
<i>and asked us for help.</i>

1430
02:06:53.750 --> 02:06:55.870
<i>He's gone back to the North</i>

1431
02:06:57.170 --> 02:06:58.460
<i>in order to meet with Tae-han Ri,</i>

1432
02:06:59.380 --> 02:07:03.210
<i>and we put
a location tracking device on him.</i>

1433
02:07:04.170 --> 02:07:07.260
<i>We're tracking his location live now.</i>

1434
02:07:08.090 --> 02:07:09.430
Well done, Comrade Eom.

1435
02:07:10.720 --> 02:07:12.310
Chief Ri is waiting for you.

1436
02:07:19.600 --> 02:07:20.810
I command

1437
02:07:20.900 --> 02:07:23.360
<i>the Republic's most elite troops.</i>

1438
02:07:24.230 --> 02:07:28.610
<i>Today, we'll get back at the US
and their allies</i>

1439
02:07:29.110 --> 02:07:34.240
<i>for all the hostile deeds
they have done to us for decades.</i>

1440
02:07:34.950 --> 02:07:36.750
<i>In a few minutes,</i>

1441
02:07:37.080 --> 02:07:43.750
<i>our nuclear bombs will explode
over South Korea and make us proud.</i>

1442
02:07:44.340 --> 02:07:47.470
<i>All of their cherished
American-made weapons</i>

1443
02:07:47.550 --> 02:07:50.930
<i>will be turned into junk.</i>

1444
02:07:51.260 --> 02:07:53.180
<i>Comrades, we should be truly proud of...</i>

1445
02:07:54.100 --> 02:07:56.720
Do you know how many of our people
will be killed by that rocket?

1446
02:07:57.230 --> 02:08:00.600
Our army must protect our people.
How can you kill them?

1447
02:08:02.610 --> 02:08:04.400
Have you turned your coat?

1448
02:08:04.480 --> 02:08:06.440
Why did you betray our leader?

1449
02:08:06.530 --> 02:08:08.490
Who betrayed whom?

1450
02:08:08.570 --> 02:08:13.410
He executed over 100 generals
who didn't even do anything wrong.

1451
02:08:13.740 --> 02:08:14.780
We're the ones

1452
02:08:14.870 --> 02:08:17.330
<i>who were betrayed by him!</i>

1453
02:08:17.410 --> 02:08:22.670
<i>We built this country
and have protected it all these years.</i>

1454
02:08:22.750 --> 02:08:27.210
We have created so many opportunities
to liberate South Korea,

1455
02:08:27.300 --> 02:08:32.470
and we even made nuclear weapons,
but he just won't use them!

1456
02:08:35.180 --> 02:08:37.600
A friend I made in the South told me this.

1457
02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:43.230
"People of a divided nation suffer more
from those who try to use

1458
02:08:43.310 --> 02:08:46.110
the division for their gain
than the division itself."

1459
02:08:48.650 --> 02:08:51.820
I witnessed the suffering
with my own eyes in Kaesong.

1460
02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:58.330
I cannot let the entire country
suffer like that.

Thank you for coming
all the way here, Mr. Kwak.

1479
02:11:46.500 --> 02:11:49.330
-How's our leader?
-He's gotten a lot better.

1480
02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:52.590
Then, he should return soon.

1481
02:11:54.670 --> 02:11:58.050
I'm sure he'll recover sooner
if peace can be guaranteed

You have a guest from South Korea.

Hello.

1486

Are you moving?

1487
02:12:23.780 --> 02:12:28.040
Yes, I'll be working

How can we ensure that?

1504
02:14:02.090 --> 02:14:05.680
Give us half of your nuclear weapons.

1505
02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:12.560
