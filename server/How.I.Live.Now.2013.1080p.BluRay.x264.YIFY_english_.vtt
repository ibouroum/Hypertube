1
00:00:09.927 --> 00:00:11.554
Imagine yourself
being successful.

2
00:00:11.637 --> 00:00:12.604
Five exercises
to make your butt smaller.

3
00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.056
77 best-loved cooking recipes.

4
00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.398
Big, fat, ugly butt.

5
00:00:18.894 --> 00:00:20.567
The possession of willpower
and self-discipline

6
00:00:20.646 --> 00:00:21.989
can be the factor
leading to success.

7
00:00:22.064 --> 00:00:23.566
Useless bitch. 88 lbs.

8
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.691
You're disgusting,
do you know that?

9
00:00:24.775 --> 00:00:25.822
Focus on your goal.

10
00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:27.744
Sensitivity or allergy
can reduce...

11
00:00:28.487 --> 00:00:30.364
God, I hate poor people...
in the body.

12
00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:33.208
What is your problem?!
Hair is your crowning glory.

13
00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:34.375
If you've got it...
Fuck you!

14
00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:36.078
Then style it in a way
that flatters your face

15
00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:38.414
and choose a great color
if you don't like your own.

16
00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.049
If you want to, try some
teeth-whitening solutions.

17
00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:43.628
Teen-dating abuse and violence
is happening everywhere.

18
00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:45.178
Take risks. Fat bitch.

19
00:00:45.254 --> 00:00:46.676
Step out of your comfort zone.

20
00:00:46.797 --> 00:00:48.799
Successful people
think big and act big.

21
00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:51.017
Why men pull away.

22
00:00:51.093 --> 00:00:53.767
Remember that success
does not guarantee happiness.

23
00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:55.939
Accept life is unfair.
Are my hips normal?

24
00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.729
Accept life is unfair.

25
00:00:57.808 --> 00:00:59.981
Fact. Eggs can live...
Don't give up.

26
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.858
If you don't give up,
you can't fail.

27
00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:03.697
You can't fail. You can't fail.
You can't fail.

Hi.

65
00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:50.421
Oh, right. Hi.
Which one are you?

66
00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:52.802
- Isaac.
- No one calls me Elizabeth.

67
00:02:52.923 --> 00:02:54.721
Except my dad,
and he's an asshole.

68
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.848
So if you don't mind,
my name's Daisy.

69
00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:59.563
Daisy, great.

70
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.775
- Where's your mom?
- Working. Um, she sent me.

71
00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:05.732
Do you want me to take that?

72
00:03:05.811 --> 00:03:06.903
Why?

73
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.398
Well, I don't know.
it... It might be heavy.

74
00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:11.279
Yeah, it is heavy.

75
00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:13.910
Okay.

76
00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:15.453
Well, um, we should...

77
00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:17.327
we should probably go
to the car.

78
00:03:17.656 --> 00:03:19.909
Yeah, sure.
Let's go to the car.

79
00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:25.080
high security.
Please remain vigilant.

80
00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:26.915
Report any suspicious behavior

81
00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:29.126
immediately
to security personnel.

82
00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:32.509
Where are you taking me?

83
00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:35.056
Oh, they charge 15 quid
for half an hour's parking.

84
00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:37.016
Sod that.

85
00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:40.140
Jesus.

86
00:03:40.262 --> 00:03:41.935
It's just down here.

87
00:03:46.268 --> 00:03:47.440
Ow!

88
00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:52.278
Here, I'll put it in the car.

89
00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:55.820
What age are you?

90
00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.988
- 14.
- 14?

91
00:03:58.155 --> 00:03:59.452
You've got a license?

92
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:01.625
No, but I've been driving
since I was six.

93
00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.257
You expect me to get in this
thing? With you?

94
00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:15.589
Well, you could get a bus
if you'd rather.

95
00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:17.429
Fine yeah, I would.

96
00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.846
It does take
about eight hours though.

97
00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:21.436
And the next one's
not due until 11:00...

98
00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:24.815
tomorrow morning.

99
00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:29.978
Welcome, by the way...

100
00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:31.153
Uh-huh.

101
00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.230
to England.

102
00:04:32.314 --> 00:04:33.281
Shit!

103
00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:34.573
Careful!

104
00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:36.659
Jesus Christ.

105
00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:40.330
Sorry. I'm better
when there's no cars around.

106
00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.633
So are you gonna stay with us
for the whole summer?

107
00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:53.009
What, I just got here.

108
00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:54.666
You want to get
rid of me already?

109
00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:55.761
No, no, no, not at all.

110
00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:57.176
We've been really looking
forward to meeting you.

111
00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.506
Piper especially.
She's the only girl

112
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.934
most of the time,
and you're our only cousin.

113
00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:02.932
So you're gonna be like
a guest of honor.

114
00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:08.233
Road!

115
00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:10.527
Yeah well,
just so you know

116
00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:12.317
I'm not one of those
stupid yanks who's gonna

117
00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:14.773
kiss your ass the whole time
because you're British, okay?

118
00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:17.571
- Okay.
- Okay.

119
00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:20.662
Have we bonded now?
Can we just shut up and drive?

120
00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:22.789
Yeah. Um, well,

121
00:05:22.948 --> 00:05:25.246

- She's here, mom! She's here!
- Get your dog away from me.

137
00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:40.449
Push 'em away, Daisy.
They'll be fine.

138
00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:41.902
- Jet! Get down!
- Go... get off of me!

142
00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:51.996
Ugh, move!

143
00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:53.295
Come here.

144
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.127
Jet, back!

145
00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:01.304
Are you okay?

146
00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:03.298
Allergy to wheat can produce

147
00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:04.473
a variety of symptoms.

148
00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:05.675
How to be...
fucking loser, fucking loser.

149
00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:06.889
Sorry about the dogs.

150
00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:08.060
They just... they just
get overexcited.

151
00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:10.146
Hey, wait a second.

152
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.313
- Who is that?
- Edmond.

153
00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:17.195
- Edmond?
- He's the oldest.

154
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.567
And this is Piper.

155
00:07:18.647 --> 00:07:20.024
She's our baby.

156
00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:21.946
I'm not a baby!

157
00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:25.408
Elizabeth, would you
like to see my unicorn?

158
00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:27.826
- Um, probably not.
- Piper, leave her alone.

159
00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:29.864
- Elizabeth, you're American.
- It's Daisy.

160
00:07:29.865 --> 00:07:32.085
No one calls me Elizabeth.
And if you don't mind,

161
00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:34.079
what I'd really like
to see is my room.

162
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.082
I need to wash my hands,
like, right now.

163
00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:39.501
I've got some kind
of canine S.T.D.

164
00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:41.969
I'll take that.

165
00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:50.145
Oh hey.
This is Joe.

166
00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:51.395
Hi.

167
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:52.597
He's our next-door neighbor.

168
00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:54.144
Well, sort of.

169
00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:56.101
But he lives with us
as much as he can.

170
00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.687
That was his dog, Gin.

171
00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:01.114
No, come back.

172
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:03.442
- Bless you.
- Hey, do you want a drink?

173
00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:04.984
No.

174
00:08:04.985 --> 00:08:07.454
And you can wash your hands
in the sink if you want.

175
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.119
- Mom! She's here!
- Piper, leave her.

176
00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:12.701
- It's not time.
- Is your mom out or...?

177
00:08:12.702 --> 00:08:14.453
No, she's in her study.

178
00:08:14.536 --> 00:08:16.129
We don't usually see her
before 9:00.

179
00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:19.083
She's an expert
in loony extremists.

180
00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:22.335
- She's going to save the world.
- Piper, shut up.

181
00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:26.427
- Take cousin Daisy to her room.
- Come on, cousin Daisy.

182
00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:29.142
I need to give you
the grand tour of the house.

183
00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:36.859
This is my unicorn
I was telling you about.

184
00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:39.986
Shh, that's mommy's office.

185
00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:43.440
Now we will come
up the stairs.

186
00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:47.987
That's the junk room
that Joe sleeps in sometimes

187
00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:49.829
when his dad's being a wanker.

188
00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:52.244
I know what a wanker is,
by the way.

189
00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:55.376
And in here is your room.

190
00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:59.290
You've so got the best
bed in the house.

191
00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:01.625
Uh-huh.

192
00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:12.974
Well, I think my dad's

193
00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:15.272
probably trying to get
through to me, so...

194
00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:19.726
I'd kind of like
to yell at him in private.

195
00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:24.489
So can you leave?

196
00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:26.115
Now, please?

197
00:09:26.357 --> 00:09:27.825
All right.

198
00:09:29.444 --> 00:09:30.616
Can I get you a cup of tea?

199
00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:33.123
No thanks.

200
00:09:56.387 --> 00:09:58.685
Glamorous, confident girl.

201
00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:01.689
I hope you get killed.
Dumb baby, dumb baby.

202
00:10:02.393 --> 00:10:03.895
Stop slouching.

203
00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:06.401
Avoid self-pity.

204
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:08.575
Itching, rashes, watery eyes,

205
00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.403
watery eyes, watery eyes...

206
00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:37.603
What do you
wanna do today, man?

207
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.018
Don't really mind.

208
00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:42.438
- I wanna go fishing.
- Mmm.

209
00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:45.066
- Go and get some fish, man.
- Hey.

210
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.113
Cousin Daisy at last!

211
00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:49.236
We thought you'd never get up.

212
00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:50.988
Morning.
Sit wherever you like.

213
00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:53.612
We've made enough for about
a thousand people.

214
00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:56.118
Mom has an emergency meeting
in London.

215
00:10:56.197 --> 00:10:58.416
She said she's sorry,
and she'll see you this evening.

216
00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:00.334
There's going to be
a World War Ill.

217
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.629
No, there isn't.
Stop being a dick,

218
00:11:02.704 --> 00:11:03.705
and get Daisy something to eat.

219
00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:04.914
I'm not a dick!

220
00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:06.921
- I'm actually not that hungry.
- Dick dick dick.

221
00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:10.136
All right, Jet, I'm doing it.

222
00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:11.463
We let you sleep in.

223
00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:13.139
Eddie said you needed
to catch up on some rest.

224
00:11:13.214 --> 00:11:16.343
- Did he?
- Are you a vampire?

225
00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:18.394
No.

226
00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:20.312
How much
dead animal do you want?

227
00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:21.856
I'm really not hungry.

228
00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:23.691
If you want,
I can make you a sandwich.

229
00:11:23.766 --> 00:11:25.234
We've got some
really nice cheese.

230
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.563
No. I don't do wheat
or cow cheese.

231
00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:29.815
- Cow cheese?
- Knob cheese.

232
00:11:30.773 --> 00:11:32.275
Why don't you eat cow cheese?

233
00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:35.032
Because it's basically
solidified cow mucus.

234
00:11:36.487 --> 00:11:38.910
It stays in your gut
for like five years.

235
00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:41.535
Morning.

236
00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:43.416
Morning.

237
00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:47.082
Did you get
through to your dad?

238
00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:48.883
Yeah. He's fine.

239
00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:52.963
Actually, Isaac, could you pass
me the water, please?

240
00:11:56.758 --> 00:11:59.056
At least eight
glasses of water a day.

241
00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:01.229
Mom said she'd call him
as soon as she can.

242
00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:02.513
Let him know you arrived safely
and all.

243
00:12:02.514 --> 00:12:03.605
No, that's fine.

244
00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:06.101
He said not to bother.

245
00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:10.234
He's kind of busy with work
and the new baby, so...

246
00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:11.439
Increasing the supply

247
00:12:11.522 --> 00:12:12.819
of the brain hormone...

248
00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:15.493
Hey.

249
00:12:16.611 --> 00:12:19.239
Have you got something
to say to me?

250
00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:22.284
What are you looking at?

251
00:12:34.128 --> 00:12:36.222
What was that all about?

252
00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:41.311
It should be
taken once a day with water.

253
00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:47.563
Stay away from distractions,

254
00:12:47.642 --> 00:12:49.861
distractions,
distractions, distractions.

255
00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:51.654
Step out of your comfort zone.

256
00:12:51.729 --> 00:12:53.402
Successful people think...

257
00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.283
Who is it?

258
00:12:58.403 --> 00:13:01.703
Uh, we're going fishing,
if you wanna come.

259
00:13:01.864 --> 00:13:03.662
I don't fish.

260
00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:27.982
Ugh, gross!

261
00:13:28.057 --> 00:13:30.810
<i>♪ You've got me in a headlock, darling ♪</i>

262
00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:33.313
<i>♪ And I don't know how to breathe ♪</i>

263
00:13:33.855 --> 00:13:36.108
<i>♪ You've turned me upside down... ♪</i>

264
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.763
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go!

265
00:14:44.842 --> 00:14:46.264
Come on, move!

266
00:14:46.344 --> 00:14:48.221
You can't have the fish.
No, you can't.

267
00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:49.430
Off!

268
00:14:49.514 --> 00:14:51.357
You don't want them.
They're all slimy.

269
00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:53.442
Come on.

270
00:14:53.851 --> 00:14:56.104
- Die! Die!
- No way, it's ceasefire.

271
00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:58.189
Terrorist forces don't
respect the ceasefire.

272
00:14:58.481 --> 00:15:00.154
- You're dead.
- You don't want fish.

273
00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:02.156
- It's disgusting.
- Wait for me.

274
00:15:04.278 --> 00:15:06.155
Not there! Come on!

275
00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:19.461
For fuck's sake,
do you understand

276
00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:21.467
the implication here?

277
00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:24.675
Have you got any idea
what you're imposing?

278
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.479
You are going to completely
lose any credibility.

279
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.068
No.

280
00:15:39.397 --> 00:15:43.322
The whole point is
to focus on the ceasefire.

281
00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.533
What's the point in going
over it all again

282
00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:46.863
when I'm getting on a plane
at 10:00 in the morning?

283
00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:49.574
We can talk about this
in-person before the briefing.

284
00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:51.542
I'm not being emotional.

285
00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:53.585
The reason my email
mentioned my kids

286
00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:55.629
is 'cause we both know
what might be about to happen

287
00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:57.548
and I've got to get on a plane
and leave them here,

288
00:15:57.623 --> 00:16:00.172
so don't expect me to be fucking
calm about it, all right?

289
00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:05.431
- Edmond?
- No.

290
00:16:05.506 --> 00:16:06.928
It's Daisy.

291
00:16:07.133 --> 00:16:09.227
Elizabeth.

292
00:16:09.385 --> 00:16:12.059
Oh, Pascale, Pascale,
I'll call you back.

293
00:16:14.849 --> 00:16:16.101
Come in.

294
00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.398
Hey.

295
00:16:21.564 --> 00:16:23.783
Look at you.

296
00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:31.411
I'm sorry I've been
so bloody useless.

297
00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:35.837
It's this peace process.
It's a complete nightmare.

298
00:16:37.288 --> 00:16:39.916
Hello? Ah, Anya.
I have spoken to Pascale,

299
00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:41.046
and I'll call you back
in five minutes.

300
00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:42.251
All right? All right.

301
00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:46.297
Sorry about that.

302
00:16:48.132 --> 00:16:49.429
Sit.

303
00:16:54.305 --> 00:16:56.103
Yes.

304
00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:57.650
Always prepare for the worst.

305
00:16:57.725 --> 00:17:00.319
It's the best way
to ensure it never happens.

306
00:17:03.397 --> 00:17:05.024
Is everything okay?

307
00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:10.659
Everything's gonna be fine.

308
00:17:12.782 --> 00:17:14.910
So...

309
00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:16.873
how are you settling in?

310
00:17:18.204 --> 00:17:20.423
Yeah, it's... it's fine.

311
00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:22.378
I hope my children
are looking after you.

312
00:17:26.337 --> 00:17:28.385
Let them wait.

313
00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:34.387
Ah, now I've got you here,
I just wanted to ask...

314
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:38.020
I've got to fly to Geneva in
the morning for a couple of days

315
00:17:38.266 --> 00:17:40.940
and I can't decide whether
or not to tell your father.

316
00:17:41.727 --> 00:17:43.149
What do you think?

317
00:17:43.312 --> 00:17:45.189
I don't want him
to worry unnecessarily.

318
00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:47.071
Don't bother.

319
00:17:47.191 --> 00:17:49.819
If my dad cared about me,
I wouldn't be here, so...

320
00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:52.238
don't worry about it.

321
00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:57.536
- What?
- Sorry. It's just...

322
00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:01.547
Just the way you said that just

323
00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:03.754
really reminded me of Julia.

324
00:18:06.043 --> 00:18:07.841
Mmm.

325
00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:10.094
It's funny.

326
00:18:11.632 --> 00:18:13.726
She used to love it here.

327
00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:17.347
It was her favorite place.

328
00:18:18.514 --> 00:18:20.482
My mom came here?

329
00:18:21.642 --> 00:18:22.985
Of course.

330
00:18:25.187 --> 00:18:27.155
Didn't your father
tell you that?

331
00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:28.399
No.

332
00:18:29.692 --> 00:18:31.069
No.

333
00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:33.579
Well, actually,
the room you're staying in,

334
00:18:33.654 --> 00:18:35.247
that's where she used to sleep.

335
00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:48.920
I've got to take this.

336
00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:50.880
Sorry.

337
00:18:51.005 --> 00:18:53.178
Yeah. Oh hi, Sam.
No no no, it's fine. It's fine.

338
00:18:53.257 --> 00:18:54.930
I'm sitting in front of it.

339
00:18:55.092 --> 00:18:57.766
If you tell me your thoughts,

340
00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.814
I will give you
a rough estimate. Yeah.

341
00:19:01.098 --> 00:19:03.271
Uh, Daisy? Daisy,
don't worry about anything.

342
00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:05.149
My friend Sally's gonna come up
and look after everything

343
00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:06.691
while I'm away, okay?

344
00:19:07.229 --> 00:19:09.072
All right. Good night!

345
00:19:09.565 --> 00:19:10.942
Yes.

346
00:19:45.893 --> 00:19:47.816
Come back quickly.

347
00:19:58.614 --> 00:20:00.616
Hey, um...
we're gonna go swimming

348
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.828
before Sally gets here
and makes us eat vegetables.

349
00:20:03.411 --> 00:20:04.913
Do you wanna come?

350
00:20:05.162 --> 00:20:06.584
I don't swim.

351
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.713
It's like a really special place.

352
00:20:09.792 --> 00:20:12.011
You'll love it.

353
00:20:12.086 --> 00:20:13.588
It's your last chance
to have some fun

354
00:20:13.671 --> 00:20:14.923
before the fascist regime.

355
00:20:16.382 --> 00:20:18.259
Uh-huh.

356
00:20:18.426 --> 00:20:20.474
Maybe next time.

357
00:20:22.596 --> 00:20:23.893
Okay.

358
00:20:29.186 --> 00:20:31.359
Stop stop.

359
00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:33.567
Stay away from distractions.
Take risks.

360
00:20:33.649 --> 00:20:35.447
Step out of your comfort zone.

361
00:20:35.526 --> 00:20:37.904
Physical shortcomings.
Find the goal of your life.

362
00:20:38.028 --> 00:20:40.998
Hey.

363
00:20:47.246 --> 00:20:48.589
Hey.

364
00:20:50.541 --> 00:20:52.919
What?
I can't change my mind?

365
00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:56.305
Oh no. Not her!

366
00:20:56.922 --> 00:20:59.050
N.B., just because
I'm attending

367
00:20:59.133 --> 00:21:01.306
doesn't mean I'm participating.

368
00:21:01.385 --> 00:21:03.183
There will be no swimming.

369
00:21:03.345 --> 00:21:04.767
Yeah, we'll see.

370
00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:07.437
- Hey, Jet, come on.
- Come on, Jet.

371
00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:09.063
- Jet!
- Come on, baby.

372
00:21:16.984 --> 00:21:18.782
Cool.

373
00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:21.197
Come on, let's go.

374
00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:22.619
Come on.

375
00:21:22.698 --> 00:21:24.371
- Come on.
- Jet!

376
00:21:29.747 --> 00:21:31.499
Can't catch me!

377
00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:43.560
Hello. Good dog.

378
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:46.598
Come on, let's go. Hey.

379
00:21:48.516 --> 00:21:50.268
Don't go near them.
Come on, let's go.

380
00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:55.149
Are those cows or bulls?
Hey, guys?

381
00:21:55.231 --> 00:21:57.154
They're cows... cows!

382
00:21:57.483 --> 00:21:59.156
Cow-cheese cows!

383
00:22:01.403 --> 00:22:03.405
It's fine. You go on.

384
00:22:03.781 --> 00:22:05.954
- They won't hurt you.
- I know.

385
00:22:06.075 --> 00:22:07.998
I'm... I'm fine.
I'm just gonna go home.

386
00:22:08.118 --> 00:22:11.088
I didn't really wanna
go swimming anyway, so.

387
00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:12.706
Wait here.

388
00:22:42.111 --> 00:22:44.409
No way.
How'd you do that?

389
00:22:55.875 --> 00:22:58.003
- Oh ow! Ow shit!
- You okay?

390
00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:00.258
Aw, fucking dirty fence.

391
00:23:00.838 --> 00:23:02.431
- You're bleeding.
- It's cool.

392
00:23:02.506 --> 00:23:04.508
- It's not a big deal.
- Let me see.

393
00:23:04.675 --> 00:23:07.349
It's really fine.

394
00:23:21.025 --> 00:23:22.618
We'd better catch up.

395
00:23:33.495 --> 00:23:35.543
- Piper!
- Look, I did it!

396
00:23:35.623 --> 00:23:38.092
Look at this! Come on!

397
00:23:38.167 --> 00:23:40.386
Oh, it's cold!
It's cold! It's cold!

398
00:23:42.546 --> 00:23:45.220
Whoo!
Jet, oh, come here.

399
00:23:47.092 --> 00:23:49.094
- Joe, come on in.
- Come on, Jet.

400
00:23:49.303 --> 00:23:51.977
- Catch! Catch, Jet!
- It's freezing.

401
00:23:52.056 --> 00:23:53.979
Seriously, man,
it's not that cold.

402
00:23:54.683 --> 00:23:57.436
Hey! Oh, careful!

403
00:23:57.978 --> 00:24:00.072
Do you have any idea
what kind of bacteria

404
00:24:00.147 --> 00:24:01.148
lives in river water?

405
00:24:01.231 --> 00:24:02.983
Not this water.
Come on, Daisy.

406
00:24:03.067 --> 00:24:04.819
No one ever comes here
and doesn't go swimming.

407
00:24:05.069 --> 00:24:07.367
Yeah well, there's a first time
for everything.

408
00:24:10.324 --> 00:24:11.951
Whoa, saved your life.

409
00:24:15.746 --> 00:24:18.374
- Daisy, come and look at this.
- What?

410
00:24:18.624 --> 00:24:20.626
Just come and you'll see.

411
00:24:21.502 --> 00:24:24.096
Quick.
You're gonna miss it.

412
00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.018
Look, can you see it
right there?

413
00:24:30.094 --> 00:24:31.687
- No.
- Look. Just right there.

414
00:24:31.804 --> 00:24:33.977
Look. Right here.

415
00:24:34.098 --> 00:24:36.476
- Right there. Look.
- All these rules...

416
00:24:37.142 --> 00:24:38.894
you think you've got
to obey them.

417
00:24:39.186 --> 00:24:40.438
What are you talking about?

418
00:24:40.562 --> 00:24:42.064
All that noise inside your head.

419
00:24:42.189 --> 00:24:43.862
Dumb baby.

420
00:24:43.941 --> 00:24:46.069
Stop it.
It's in your head.

421
00:25:00.791 --> 00:25:02.543
You fuck!

422
00:25:08.799 --> 00:25:10.392
He loves me.

423
00:25:10.551 --> 00:25:12.428
He loves me not.

424
00:25:12.678 --> 00:25:14.351
He loves me.

425
00:25:14.513 --> 00:25:16.231
He loves me not.

426
00:25:23.647 --> 00:25:25.820
This is how you make
the best marshmallows.

427
00:25:26.025 --> 00:25:27.652
Place it in quite a small place

428
00:25:27.901 --> 00:25:29.244
and make sure
it's quite a hot place.

429
00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:30.738
Don't put it in for too long.

430
00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.623
Try some of this.

431
00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.492
- Mmm, do I have to?
- Yes.

432
00:25:34.575 --> 00:25:35.997
It's really good.

433
00:25:43.834 --> 00:25:46.383
Mmm.

434
00:25:46.545 --> 00:25:48.388
These are actually pretty good.

435
00:25:59.808 --> 00:26:01.435
What's up with them?

436
00:26:01.643 --> 00:26:03.395
It's probably Sally just
getting into the house.

437
00:26:03.562 --> 00:26:05.906
- They can hear for miles.
- Sally's our au pair.

438
00:26:05.981 --> 00:26:07.983
She's got
double-jointed thumbs.

439
00:26:44.812 --> 00:26:47.156
What's happening?

440
00:26:52.319 --> 00:26:54.162
I'd better get home.

441
00:26:56.698 --> 00:26:58.871
It's snowing.

442
00:27:06.792 --> 00:27:08.339
Get the stuff.
We're going.

443
00:27:10.087 --> 00:27:11.885
Piper, come on.
We're going now.

444
00:27:13.799 --> 00:27:15.267
Sally!

445
00:27:15.801 --> 00:27:17.519
Sally!

446
00:27:21.098 --> 00:27:22.771
Sally?

447
00:27:22.975 --> 00:27:24.852
Sally!

448
00:27:28.772 --> 00:27:30.820
I wanna see what the TV says.

449
00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.492
Piper.

450
00:27:32.609 --> 00:27:34.452
- What's going on?
- Sally's not here.

451
00:27:34.778 --> 00:27:37.247
And I tried phoning mom,
but the phone's not working.

452
00:27:37.406 --> 00:27:39.625
Hey, guys, quickly,
come and see this.

453
00:27:43.537 --> 00:27:45.631
that up to
15 different groups

454
00:27:45.706 --> 00:27:47.333
have claimed responsibility
for this attack.

455
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.548
And to repeat,
we appear to be talking

456
00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:54.048
about a nuclear device
which has killed tens,

457
00:27:54.214 --> 00:27:56.387
if not hundreds of thousands
of people

458
00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:58.473
in and around the capital.

459
00:27:58.552 --> 00:28:00.520
And we're beginning
to hear of fallout

460
00:28:00.596 --> 00:28:03.349
as far afield as Bristol...

461
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.648
Why did the TV go off?

462
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:14.368
Where's mom?
We've got to go and get mom.

463
00:28:14.484 --> 00:28:15.986
Piper, shut up!
Stop being a baby!

464
00:28:16.153 --> 00:28:18.326
Hey, it's scary.
Leave her alone.

465
00:28:18.989 --> 00:28:20.616
Power cut. The whole house.

466
00:28:20.908 --> 00:28:22.501
Isaac, get the torch.

467
00:28:25.204 --> 00:28:28.003
Eddie, what's a nuclear?

468
00:28:28.498 --> 00:28:31.172
It's just something
they say on the TV.

469
00:28:31.543 --> 00:28:33.136
Shush now. Come here.

470
00:28:34.546 --> 00:28:36.548
Radio might tell us more, eh?

471
00:28:37.591 --> 00:28:39.343
How far away is London?

472
00:28:39.801 --> 00:28:40.768
Far.

473
00:28:40.969 --> 00:28:42.471
We heard the sound.
We heard it happen.

474
00:28:42.888 --> 00:28:44.231
Boom!

475
00:28:44.598 --> 00:28:46.692
- Isaac.
- You fucking asshole!

476
00:28:53.023 --> 00:28:54.616
It's not a game.

477
00:28:58.862 --> 00:29:00.489
powerful today
would wreak havoc

478
00:29:00.572 --> 00:29:02.745
on our communication systems,
potentially resulting

479
00:29:02.824 --> 00:29:04.292
in the blackouts
that last for months.

480
00:29:04.368 --> 00:29:05.790
It should be taken
once a day with water.

481
00:29:07.204 --> 00:29:08.831
Stop slouching, itching.

482
00:29:08.914 --> 00:29:11.542
God, I hate... 88 lbs.
What is your problem?

483
00:29:11.625 --> 00:29:13.673
Hurry the fuck up.
You're disgusting.

484
00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:14.719
Disgusting!
Did you know that?

485
00:29:14.795 --> 00:29:16.092
I'm a fucking curse.

486
00:29:30.227 --> 00:29:32.480
I keep thinking about mom.

487
00:29:33.939 --> 00:29:35.486
Mom's in Switzerland.

488
00:29:35.774 --> 00:29:37.401
Nothing ever happens
in Switzerland.

489
00:29:37.859 --> 00:29:39.406
I want to talk to her.

490
00:29:39.486 --> 00:29:40.988
You can't, remember?

491
00:29:41.071 --> 00:29:42.448
The phone's not working.

492
00:29:46.034 --> 00:29:48.287
I bet mom's already
on her way home.

493
00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:49.542
She's not gonna
stick around in Geneva

494
00:29:49.621 --> 00:29:51.623
once she knows what's
happened here, is she?

495
00:29:52.165 --> 00:29:53.041
No way.

496
00:29:53.125 --> 00:29:54.968
She'll probably be
on the next flight home.

497
00:29:55.085 --> 00:29:57.258
Mom's an expert.
She'll know what to do.

498
00:29:57.629 --> 00:29:59.051
We've just gotta wait.

499
00:30:07.139 --> 00:30:09.016
...recorded announcement.

500
00:30:09.266 --> 00:30:11.860
The government has declared
a state of emergency.

501
00:30:12.561 --> 00:30:14.108
Do not panic.

502
00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:16.152
Following the detonation
of a device

503
00:30:16.231 --> 00:30:20.327
at 1600 hours today,
civil law has been suspended.

504
00:30:21.236 --> 00:30:23.330
Any civilians caught
defying martial law

505
00:30:23.488 --> 00:30:25.707
will be subject
to court-martial.

506
00:30:25.782 --> 00:30:27.159
Stay in your homes

507
00:30:27.242 --> 00:30:28.915
and await further information.

508
00:30:28.994 --> 00:30:29.870
Hey, come here.

509
00:30:29.953 --> 00:30:32.797
This is a special
recorded announcement.

510
00:30:33.707 --> 00:30:35.801
Shh shh shh shh.

511
00:30:36.877 --> 00:30:38.345
All right?

512
00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.047
Mom's fine.

513
00:31:36.561 --> 00:31:38.279
Daisy.

514
00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.982
Daisy.

515
00:31:41.691 --> 00:31:42.943
Shh.

516
00:31:43.485 --> 00:31:45.487
I want to show you something.

517
00:31:45.987 --> 00:31:47.830
They said stay home.

518
00:31:47.948 --> 00:31:49.245
The woods are home.

519
00:31:49.324 --> 00:31:50.701
What if there's like
radioactivity

520
00:31:50.784 --> 00:31:52.252
in the air
or fallout or something?

521
00:31:53.286 --> 00:31:54.503
Eddie.

522
00:31:55.122 --> 00:31:56.465
Eddie.

523
00:32:09.302 --> 00:32:11.145
Oh my God.

524
00:32:11.763 --> 00:32:13.515
She had a broken wing.

525
00:32:13.682 --> 00:32:15.559
It needed a chance to heal.

526
00:32:15.976 --> 00:32:17.649
Is it okay?

527
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:23.316
She's ready.

528
00:33:02.772 --> 00:33:04.024
Whoa!

529
00:33:14.576 --> 00:33:16.249
She's beautiful.

530
00:33:23.877 --> 00:33:25.754
I'm so sorry.

531
00:33:27.005 --> 00:33:28.552
It's all my fault.

532
00:33:30.425 --> 00:33:31.893
What is?

533
00:33:33.595 --> 00:33:35.188
Daisy?

534
00:33:36.723 --> 00:33:38.725
I'm a fucking curse.

535
00:33:43.688 --> 00:33:45.156
What are you talking about?

536
00:33:45.315 --> 00:33:47.363
Everywhere I go...

537
00:33:48.276 --> 00:33:50.324
bad shit happens.

538
00:33:50.904 --> 00:33:52.952
I'm glad you came.

539
00:33:56.159 --> 00:33:58.161
It's better with you here.

540
00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.174
New Zealand's in, like,
the middle of nowhere.

541
00:34:10.257 --> 00:34:12.259
It must be, like,
so cool to live there.

542
00:34:12.801 --> 00:34:16.305
Like there'd be, like,
no one around.

543
00:34:23.937 --> 00:34:26.031
Look, Geneva's not
that far away.

544
00:34:26.523 --> 00:34:28.275
Mom could probably drive home.

545
00:34:36.157 --> 00:34:38.751
- You're bluffing.
- No, I'm not.

546
00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:41.504
- You're cheating.
- What?

547
00:34:43.081 --> 00:34:45.630
Looking into
my mind like that.

548
00:35:04.144 --> 00:35:05.396
- You okay?
- Yeah.

549
00:35:05.478 --> 00:35:06.900
I'm just gonna get some air.

550
00:36:03.703 --> 00:36:05.705
No.

551
00:36:05.914 --> 00:36:08.212
- We... we can't. We're...
- Daisy.

552
00:36:14.089 --> 00:36:15.466
No, we shouldn't.

553
00:36:15.882 --> 00:36:17.304
We can't.

554
00:36:19.636 --> 00:36:21.309
More rules?

555
00:36:44.452 --> 00:36:46.045
Stay here.

556
00:36:49.999 --> 00:36:52.127
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yeah,

557
00:36:52.293 --> 00:36:54.842
I hope so.
I'm looking for...

558
00:36:55.171 --> 00:36:57.765
Is there a Miss Elizabeth
Ryback here?

559
00:37:02.595 --> 00:37:04.814
I'm sorry.
This is confidential.

560
00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:06.562
They're my cousins.

561
00:37:06.641 --> 00:37:08.643
Just the same,
if you don't mind.

562
00:37:10.729 --> 00:37:12.197
Okay.

563
00:37:20.405 --> 00:37:22.624
I'm from the American consulate

564
00:37:22.907 --> 00:37:25.501
in Edinburgh.

565
00:37:25.702 --> 00:37:29.707
You are Miss Elizabeth Ryback,

566
00:37:29.831 --> 00:37:32.755
the daughter of Julia Ryback,
deceased,

567
00:37:32.834 --> 00:37:35.212
and David Ryback
of New York City.

568
00:37:39.174 --> 00:37:40.676
Shh!

569
00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.817
What about my cousins?

570
00:37:59.652 --> 00:38:01.746
If they're not U.S. Citizens,
I can't help you.

571
00:38:15.877 --> 00:38:18.300
Hey.
Thanks for all your help.

572
00:38:20.215 --> 00:38:21.933
Can you tell us
what's going on?

573
00:38:22.425 --> 00:38:23.677
Out there?

574
00:38:24.052 --> 00:38:25.929
Try not to worry, okay?

575
00:38:26.179 --> 00:38:28.273
They're gonna start
an evacuation of this area

576
00:38:28.348 --> 00:38:29.770
in the next couple of days.

577
00:38:29.849 --> 00:38:31.817
I'm sure they're gonna
take you to a more

578
00:38:31.976 --> 00:38:34.024
secure environment, so...

579
00:38:34.145 --> 00:38:36.364
just sit tight.

580
00:38:38.024 --> 00:38:39.241
Stay inside.

581
00:39:16.938 --> 00:39:18.656
He gave me a ticket home.

582
00:39:19.107 --> 00:39:20.108
They're going to pick me up

583
00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:21.943
from the village
in the morning.

584
00:39:25.697 --> 00:39:26.698
I know.

585
00:39:28.616 --> 00:39:30.539
Of course you do.

586
00:39:31.953 --> 00:39:33.455
I'm glad.

587
00:39:33.872 --> 00:39:35.419
I want you to be safe.

588
00:39:37.375 --> 00:39:38.627
Eddie.

589
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:40.007
Don't worry about us.

590
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:41.887
We'll be fine.

591
00:39:42.881 --> 00:39:44.849
There's a barn
on the other side of the woods.

592
00:39:45.216 --> 00:39:46.684
We'll move up there.

593
00:39:47.135 --> 00:39:48.933
I don't care about
some stupid evacuation.

594
00:39:49.846 --> 00:39:51.473
This is our home.

595
00:39:51.556 --> 00:39:52.978
We're not leaving.

596
00:39:59.814 --> 00:40:00.986
Charge!

597
00:40:04.569 --> 00:40:06.287
Come on, let's go! Go go go!

598
00:40:06.404 --> 00:40:07.906
We're taking them on the inside!

599
00:40:07.989 --> 00:40:10.287
Ugh, get off.

600
00:40:12.911 --> 00:40:14.709
It's a ray gun!

601
00:40:14.787 --> 00:40:16.380
Come on, come on.

602
00:40:21.586 --> 00:40:23.213
Hey, Pipes.

603
00:40:24.923 --> 00:40:26.891
Ooh, sorry.

604
00:40:27.008 --> 00:40:28.134
Ready?

605
00:40:28.551 --> 00:40:30.645
You got it?

606
00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:32.518
Remember, you're sleeping
up here with me tonight.

607
00:40:32.764 --> 00:40:33.890
- Okay.
- Daisy,

608
00:40:33.973 --> 00:40:35.475
you've got to sleep there

609
00:40:35.558 --> 00:40:38.357
since you're only staying here
for one night.

610
00:40:38.686 --> 00:40:40.734
So you've got to have
the worst bed.

611
00:40:47.278 --> 00:40:50.031
Come on, Jet!
Come on!

612
00:41:00.041 --> 00:41:01.884
Quick!

613
00:41:02.251 --> 00:41:04.800
Joe, chuck it over here!

614
00:41:09.384 --> 00:41:10.977
That's a good boy.

615
00:43:24.268 --> 00:43:25.690
What are you doing?

616
00:43:29.607 --> 00:43:31.405
I'm so scared.

617
00:43:32.193 --> 00:43:33.615
And I wanna know

618
00:43:33.694 --> 00:43:35.412
what it's like to be 17.

619
00:43:35.655 --> 00:43:37.328
Or 25, you know?

620
00:43:37.406 --> 00:43:38.828
Daisy.

621
00:43:39.659 --> 00:43:42.162
But what if we can
get through this...

622
00:43:42.829 --> 00:43:44.831
and there's life
on the other side?

623
00:43:47.041 --> 00:43:48.884
If there is,

624
00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:52.214
I wanna be here with you.

625
00:43:54.632 --> 00:43:56.430
This is how I wanna live.

626
00:43:57.426 --> 00:43:59.303
And if all this isn't here

627
00:43:59.428 --> 00:44:01.305
and you don't survive,

628
00:44:01.973 --> 00:44:03.691
then I don't wanna live at all.

629
00:44:04.225 --> 00:44:05.977
No!

630
00:44:30.293 --> 00:44:31.510
Come on! I'm gonna win!

All right, Piper,
help me serve it up.

646
00:45:43.241 --> 00:45:44.367
I'm so hungry.

647
00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:45.542
Pass me some twiglets.

648
00:45:45.543 --> 00:45:46.456
No.

649
00:45:46.535 --> 00:45:47.457
- Try it.
- No.

650
00:45:47.536 --> 00:45:48.628
Just try it.
It's good, try it.

651
00:45:50.873 --> 00:45:54.093
<i>- ♪ Which do you dance for? ♪</i>

652
00:45:54.168 --> 00:45:55.465
I need my glasses!

653
00:45:55.544 --> 00:45:57.797
<i>- ♪ Which makes you shine? ♪
- Whoo!</i>

655
00:46:03.427 --> 00:46:05.100
What's up?

656
00:46:05.179 --> 00:46:06.431
Have a read.

657
00:46:06.514 --> 00:46:09.142
"Residents of the address above
are ordered to evacuate

658
00:46:09.225 --> 00:46:11.819
within 24 hours of this
notice being given."

659
00:46:11.936 --> 00:46:13.233
- I don't wanna leave.
- Stay with us.

660
00:46:13.354 --> 00:46:14.901
- We haven't got one.
- Can't.

661
00:46:15.022 --> 00:46:16.239
Well, don't tell
anyone we're here.

662
00:46:16.315 --> 00:46:17.362
Keep it there,
keep it there.

663
00:46:17.441 --> 00:46:18.533
Just let it catch fire.

664
00:46:20.403 --> 00:46:21.575
No, leave it, leave it!

665
00:46:21.654 --> 00:46:23.873
- Leave it!
- It's gonna go out.

666
00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:34.876
Come on, gin, come on.

667
00:46:35.042 --> 00:46:36.919
- See ya! Bye!
- Goodbye, Joe!

668
00:46:37.962 --> 00:46:40.056
- Bye, Joe!
- Bye!

669
00:47:07.533 --> 00:47:08.910
- What?
- Don't move! Fire!

670
00:47:08.993 --> 00:47:10.165
- Get down!
- The windows!

671
00:47:10.244 --> 00:47:11.245
Dase, get down.

672
00:47:13.831 --> 00:47:16.300
- Isaac, Piper!
- Eddie!

673
00:47:16.375 --> 00:47:18.252
- I don't want to die!
- Come here.

674
00:47:18.336 --> 00:47:19.804
- Come here, it's all right.
- What's going on?

675
00:47:19.879 --> 00:47:21.802
- Clear!
- Stay down, stay down!

676
00:47:21.881 --> 00:47:23.929
Keep your head down!
Isaac!

677
00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:25.848
Fire!

678
00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:28.229
Move move move!

679
00:47:28.304 --> 00:47:30.807
- Right, go!
- Position ready!

680
00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:33.518
Don't shoot!

681
00:47:33.642 --> 00:47:35.690
- In the building!
- Don't shoot!

682
00:47:35.811 --> 00:47:37.108
Don't shoot, please!
Don't shoot us!

683
00:47:37.188 --> 00:47:38.690
- Eddie, Eddie!
- Please please.

684
00:47:38.773 --> 00:47:40.195
Get down!
Let me see your hands!

685
00:47:40.274 --> 00:47:41.571
Down down down!

686
00:47:44.236 --> 00:47:46.034
Move out!

687
00:47:46.155 --> 00:47:48.499
- Get down on the floor now!
- Put your head down!

688
00:47:48.616 --> 00:47:51.540
Moving out!

689
00:47:51.619 --> 00:47:53.838
This whole area's
crawling with enemy units.

690
00:47:53.913 --> 00:47:55.586
Okay, we need to get you
out of here fast.

691
00:47:55.664 --> 00:47:57.507
Girls, follow me.
Boys, how old are you?

692
00:47:57.583 --> 00:47:59.051
I'm 16. I'm old enough
to look after all of us.

693
00:47:59.126 --> 00:48:00.298
- How old are you?
- 14.

694
00:48:00.419 --> 00:48:02.342
We don't need help.

695
00:48:02.463 --> 00:48:03.885
I want the girls in residential.

696
00:48:04.006 --> 00:48:05.758
Boys, these two, Gatesfield.

697
00:48:06.175 --> 00:48:07.301
Stay where you are.

698
00:48:07.385 --> 00:48:09.308
Girls, what did I say?
Get in the van.

699
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:10.392
Boys, you wait there

700
00:48:10.471 --> 00:48:11.848
and someone'll come down
and advise you.

701
00:48:12.014 --> 00:48:13.391
What's Gatesfield?

702
00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:16.068
Look, this is not a discussion.

703
00:48:16.143 --> 00:48:18.111
- This is an order.
- I'm a U.S. citizen.

704
00:48:18.187 --> 00:48:19.734
We're not going anywhere,
and I wanna speak

705
00:48:19.814 --> 00:48:22.112
to the American embassy
right now!

706
00:48:22.316 --> 00:48:24.364
- Reynolds! Atherty!
- Sarge?

707
00:48:24.443 --> 00:48:26.366
Get them in the van.

708
00:48:26.654 --> 00:48:29.032
Wherever they take you,
find a way to get back here.

709
00:48:29.198 --> 00:48:30.791
Promise me.

710
00:48:30.866 --> 00:48:32.539
Son, out of the way.

711
00:48:32.701 --> 00:48:34.328
- Girls, in the van.
- You can't split us up.

712
00:48:34.495 --> 00:48:36.748
- Eddie... Eddie, don't.
- Move out of the way.

713
00:48:36.831 --> 00:48:39.425
- Stay away from us.
- I'm not gonna tell you again.

714
00:48:41.627 --> 00:48:43.174
- Girls, you're coming with me.
- No!

715
00:48:43.587 --> 00:48:44.759
- Get off me!
- Calm down.

716
00:48:45.005 --> 00:48:46.507
- Just keep still.
- Get off!

717
00:48:46.674 --> 00:48:47.891
Calm down.

718
00:48:48.008 --> 00:48:49.601
- Eddie! Eddie!
- Come on, miss.

719
00:48:50.469 --> 00:48:51.766
- Eddie!
- Daisy! Let her go!

720
00:48:51.846 --> 00:48:53.598
- Restrain her. Get her in.
- Get off of me!

721
00:48:53.764 --> 00:48:55.687
- No!
- Get off!

722
00:48:56.016 --> 00:48:57.188
- Piper!
- Eddie, stop it!

723
00:48:57.351 --> 00:48:59.570
- Eddie!
- You need to fucking calm down!

724
00:48:59.812 --> 00:49:02.031
Remember what I said, Daisy!

725
00:49:02.106 --> 00:49:03.983
- Get off her!
- Just sit down.

726
00:49:06.986 --> 00:49:09.159
Just sit down, sit down.
Calm down.

727
00:49:10.614 --> 00:49:11.957
I won't tell you again.
Sit down.

728
00:49:12.366 --> 00:49:13.743
Daisy!

729
00:49:15.035 --> 00:49:16.378
Remember what I said!

730
00:50:41.622 --> 00:50:42.669
Move it!

731
00:51:12.278 --> 00:51:14.155
You two, out.

732
00:51:27.459 --> 00:51:28.756
Come in.

733
00:51:38.971 --> 00:51:41.724
I'm Mrs. McEvoy,
and this is my home.

734
00:51:41.849 --> 00:51:44.978
So please, make sure
you treat it with respect.

735
00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:47.108
There we are.

736
00:51:48.314 --> 00:51:49.566
This way, please.

737
00:52:03.454 --> 00:52:06.458
Toilet's through there.

738
00:52:06.874 --> 00:52:08.672
Bucket's by the toilet.

739
00:52:08.917 --> 00:52:11.045
Water tablets are
on ration since yesterday,

740
00:52:11.128 --> 00:52:13.472
so you'll have to wait
till Friday to have a wash.

741
00:52:14.506 --> 00:52:16.053
Here we are.

742
00:52:17.384 --> 00:52:19.807
Only one rule in here.

743
00:52:20.387 --> 00:52:23.015
Don't touch any
of Nick's stuff, okay?

744
00:52:23.265 --> 00:52:24.938
He will come home.

745
00:52:26.518 --> 00:52:28.816
- So.
- Water tablets?

746
00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:31.232
My dear child,
where have you been?

747
00:52:31.315 --> 00:52:33.317
The terrorists contaminated
the water supply.

748
00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:35.448
We have to clean it
before we go near it.

749
00:52:35.569 --> 00:52:38.664
We've been drinking water
at home, and swimming.

750
00:52:39.365 --> 00:52:41.538
Well, you should
consider yourself lucky.

751
00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:44.624
I'll give you a call
when supper's ready.

752
00:52:44.745 --> 00:52:46.588
The major will be home soon.

753
00:53:02.388 --> 00:53:04.482
How... how...

754
00:53:04.556 --> 00:53:06.308
- Mommy.
- What?

755
00:53:06.725 --> 00:53:08.147
How-.

756
00:53:08.268 --> 00:53:10.646
How will mommy find us?

757
00:53:11.063 --> 00:53:12.861
Hey.

758
00:53:12.981 --> 00:53:15.279
Come on, don't worry
about that now.

759
00:53:17.653 --> 00:53:19.326
I want my mommy.

760
00:53:21.407 --> 00:53:23.080
I know.

761
00:53:28.163 --> 00:53:30.086
Don't cry.

762
00:53:31.375 --> 00:53:33.469
I'm here and...

763
00:53:33.544 --> 00:53:35.763
and your mom's okay.

764
00:53:36.672 --> 00:53:38.174
She's just been held up.

765
00:53:43.554 --> 00:53:45.056
Come here.

766
00:53:51.145 --> 00:53:53.193
We're going to get home, okay?

767
00:53:55.274 --> 00:53:56.867
I promise.

768
00:53:57.568 --> 00:53:59.161
But we need to be strong.

769
00:54:04.825 --> 00:54:07.419
How was the farm today, dear?

770
00:54:08.287 --> 00:54:11.791
People seem to be
getting the hang of it.

771
00:54:11.999 --> 00:54:15.344
It's hard work,
but someone's got to do it.

772
00:54:15.544 --> 00:54:18.468
People do what they have to
when times are tough.

773
00:54:19.131 --> 00:54:21.554
Don't we, girls? Eh?

774
00:54:21.633 --> 00:54:22.805
...terrorist units control

775
00:54:22.885 --> 00:54:25.638
some portions of the country.
Remain calm.

776
00:54:25.763 --> 00:54:28.937
Do not leave your homes
unless absolutely necessary.

777
00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:31.272
DO not leave secure zones.

778
00:54:31.518 --> 00:54:34.237
This is the wartime
radio service.

779
00:54:42.237 --> 00:54:43.363
And now here is the official

780
00:54:43.447 --> 00:54:45.449
6:00 news bulletin.

781
00:54:45.616 --> 00:54:47.869
Violent outbreaks have been
reported across the region,

782
00:54:47.951 --> 00:54:49.669
as guerrilla groups
battle for territory

783
00:54:49.745 --> 00:54:52.123
beyond the government-allocated
secure zones.

784
00:54:52.664 --> 00:54:53.756
Civilians are reminded

785
00:54:53.832 --> 00:54:55.505
that traveling outside
the secure zones

786
00:54:55.584 --> 00:54:57.382
is currently
restricted until further...

787
00:55:00.506 --> 00:55:02.383
Is that two or three of them?

788
00:55:04.927 --> 00:55:07.271
We've got another group
to pick up.

789
00:55:07.429 --> 00:55:08.681
Mind your step.

790
00:55:10.933 --> 00:55:12.526
Mind your head.

791
00:55:18.774 --> 00:55:20.742
I can't even
feel my fingers.

00:56:30.721 --> 00:56:32.439
- Yeah, let it go.

00:56:49.323 --> 00:56:51.540
That's right, Lucy,
put your back into it.

00:56:51.541 --> 00:56:52.659

827
00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:20.521
She's here!

828
00:57:20.604 --> 00:57:22.356
No one ever comes here
and doesn't go swimming!

829
00:57:22.564 --> 00:57:24.282
She used to love it here.

830
00:57:24.775 --> 00:57:26.618
I'm home.

831
00:57:37.204 --> 00:57:39.832
Wait for me.

832
00:57:42.292 --> 00:57:43.669
I've got everything together.

833
00:57:43.752 --> 00:57:45.127
We're ready to go.

834
00:57:45.128 --> 00:57:47.677
And guess what?
I had a dream about Eddie.

835
00:57:48.006 --> 00:57:49.929
- Eddie?
- And he's home already.

836
00:57:51.551 --> 00:57:53.144
I can feel it.

837
00:57:54.096 --> 00:57:56.394
All right? Mind how you go.

838
00:57:57.891 --> 00:57:59.518
Do you need a hand?

839
00:58:00.352 --> 00:58:01.945
Attention all workers.

840
00:58:02.229 --> 00:58:04.527
If at any time you would
like to clean your hands,

841
00:58:04.815 --> 00:58:06.613
please make your way
to Water Zone D.

842
00:58:07.234 --> 00:58:09.111
For your own safety,
you are reminded

843
00:58:09.194 --> 00:58:11.492
to follow hygiene procedure
at all times.

844
00:58:14.992 --> 00:58:16.539
Joe?

845
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:19.584
Oh, Joe.
What are you doing here?

846
00:58:19.746 --> 00:58:21.748
Working.

847
00:58:21.915 --> 00:58:23.713
- Are you okay?
- Remember,

848
00:58:23.792 --> 00:58:24.759
if you don't know the source...

849
00:58:24.835 --> 00:58:26.257
What happened to your face?

850
00:58:26.878 --> 00:58:28.004
Nothing.

851
00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:30.349
Just a fight with some boys.

852
00:58:30.590 --> 00:58:32.183
They took my dad away.

853
00:58:32.759 --> 00:58:35.683
I'm staying in this weird house
with other kids.

854
00:58:36.013 --> 00:58:38.357
Have you seen Eddie or Isaac?

855
00:58:39.016 --> 00:58:40.939
No.

856
00:58:41.018 --> 00:58:43.362
Be vigilant.

857
00:58:43.437 --> 00:58:44.734
They... they said Gin...

858
00:58:44.813 --> 00:58:46.736
Be suspicious.
Be responsible.

859
00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:50.197
- Hey.
- What happened to Gin?

860
00:58:50.277 --> 00:58:51.745
Come on, everyone!
Trucks are here!

861
00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:53.322
- Load up now! Come on!
- Come on.

862
00:58:53.405 --> 00:58:54.452
Come on, girls, that's it.

863
00:58:54.531 --> 00:58:56.033
Attention all workers.

864
00:58:56.158 --> 00:58:58.160
Attention. Be alert.

865
00:58:58.285 --> 00:59:00.629
Come on, you two.
Go on, son.

866
00:59:00.704 --> 00:59:01.705
You go with them today.

867
00:59:02.622 --> 00:59:04.249
- Good man.
- Do not leave the secure area.

868
00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:06.047
Last to go.

869
00:59:18.263 --> 00:59:19.981
Joe, we're escaping, Joe.

870
00:59:20.348 --> 00:59:21.770
Going home.

871
00:59:21.975 --> 00:59:23.693
I've got everything ready.

872
00:59:24.686 --> 00:59:26.404
Will you come with us?

873
00:59:26.646 --> 00:59:28.148
There's no point.

874
00:59:29.274 --> 00:59:30.571
It's all gone.

875
00:59:32.027 --> 00:59:33.700
Everyone's dead.

876
00:59:45.123 --> 00:59:47.751
- Want some?
- Put that away!

877
00:59:47.959 --> 00:59:49.085
Checkpoint.

878
01:00:05.519 --> 01:00:07.442
- Why have we stopped?
- I don't know.

879
01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:08.734
Can you see
what's going on?

880
01:00:10.065 --> 01:00:11.783
Is that a fire?

881
01:00:16.196 --> 01:00:17.322
Get down, everybody!

882
01:00:17.405 --> 01:00:18.782
Get down! Stay down!

883
01:00:19.574 --> 01:00:21.042
They've taken
the checkpoint!

884
01:00:28.834 --> 01:00:31.303
Hang on, hang on!

885
01:00:31.753 --> 01:00:34.472
Come on!
Shit, we're stuck!

886
01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:35.636
- We're stuck!
- Stay down, everyone.

887
01:00:35.757 --> 01:00:37.976
Joe!

888
01:00:38.218 --> 01:00:40.437
- Get down!
- Fucking cocks!

889
01:00:40.595 --> 01:00:42.973
- Did you hear that?
- Joe, get down!

890
01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:44.433
- Joe, get down!
- Down!

891
01:00:44.516 --> 01:00:46.189
- You killed my dog!
- Joe, please.

892
01:00:46.434 --> 01:00:48.357
- Get down!
- We're gonna blow your brains...

893
01:00:48.436 --> 01:00:49.528
Joe!

894
01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:58.447
Quick! Oh my God!

895
01:00:58.530 --> 01:00:59.531
Rock!

896
01:01:04.369 --> 01:01:06.542
- Please.
- Killed my dog.

897
01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:13.427
Look!

898
01:01:14.629 --> 01:01:16.006
They're coming!

899
01:01:20.135 --> 01:01:21.478
Quick!

900
01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:25.057
Hey!

901
01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:26.274
Try it now!

902
01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:29.687
- Floor it!
- Come on!

903
01:01:53.001 --> 01:01:54.674
They've taken the checkpoint.

904
01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:57.214
We had to go all the way round
to the other side.

905
01:01:57.297 --> 01:01:58.469
We need to leave here now.

906
01:01:58.548 --> 01:01:59.845
We have to wait for Nick!

907
01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:14.606
She told us not
to touch his stuff.

908
01:02:14.689 --> 01:02:16.737
Her stupid son's gone to war,

909
01:02:16.816 --> 01:02:18.989
and he's not coming back.

910
01:02:19.277 --> 01:02:21.154
We have to go now.

911
01:02:21.279 --> 01:02:22.531
It's dangerous here.

912
01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:32.336
Look at me.

913
01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:33.925
Look at me.

914
01:02:34.042 --> 01:02:36.090
We're gonna get
through this, okay?

915
01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:38.759
You just gotta take
that bad thing,

916
01:02:38.838 --> 01:02:40.681
you take it,
you put it in a box,

917
01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:41.758
you close the lid,

918
01:02:41.841 --> 01:02:44.344
you look up and you focus
on your goal, okay?

919
01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:46.146
Because that's what
you have to do now.

920
01:02:46.221 --> 01:02:48.644
You have to look up
and focus on your goal!

921
01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:09.578
Put your stuff on.
Quick.

922
01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:16.460
Don't be stupid, woman.

923
01:03:16.543 --> 01:03:18.261
- It's not safe here.
- I will stay here

924
01:03:18.336 --> 01:03:20.634
till my son comes back.
I'm going nowhere!

925
01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:22.091
They're gonna
be here any minute.

926
01:03:22.173 --> 01:03:24.551
You can't make me.
I am waiting here for my Nick.

927
01:03:44.404 --> 01:03:46.281
Eddie?

928
01:03:46.406 --> 01:03:48.579
Eddie, Eddie! Are you here?

929
01:03:50.744 --> 01:03:52.667
Eddie, come back!

930
01:03:52.746 --> 01:03:54.623
Eddie, are you here?

931
01:03:54.706 --> 01:03:56.049
Eddie! Eddie!

932
01:04:05.175 --> 01:04:08.349
My feet hurt, Daisy.
Can we stop for a bit?

933
01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:10.104
No.

934
01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:13.232
- Please!
- Not now.

935
01:04:13.475 --> 01:04:15.398
We've got six or seven clays'
walk ahead of us.

936
01:04:15.477 --> 01:04:17.354
We need to be disciplined.

937
01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:19.606
Come on.
The boys are waiting.

938
01:04:25.904 --> 01:04:28.999
Water tablets. Shit!

939
01:04:31.117 --> 01:04:32.369
Stop drinking.

940
01:04:32.452 --> 01:04:34.921
I forgot the fucking
water tablets!

941
01:04:35.622 --> 01:04:37.590
We need to save that.

942
01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:40.802
I knew I'd fuck it up.

943
01:04:42.337 --> 01:04:44.260
God damn it, Daisy.
What's the matter with you?

944
01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:51.513
Come on, Piper.
We need to get out of the open.

945
01:06:09.382 --> 01:06:13.307
Do you think
Eddie and Isaac are okay?

946
01:06:16.097 --> 01:06:18.191
Yeah, of course they are.

947
01:06:28.693 --> 01:06:30.161
Chocolates!

948
01:06:32.113 --> 01:06:33.456
Piper, come on!

949
01:06:38.286 --> 01:06:39.754
Piper!

950
01:06:57.764 --> 01:06:59.232
Finish it.

951
01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:06.823
We need to keep moving.

952
01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.988
- Are you okay?
- I said keep moving.

953
01:07:34.968 --> 01:07:36.595
Daisy?

954
01:07:36.928 --> 01:07:38.521
Eddie?

955
01:07:47.272 --> 01:07:49.570
Help.

956
01:07:50.108 --> 01:07:51.485
Help me!

957
01:08:22.307 --> 01:08:24.526
No, stop it!

958
01:08:27.604 --> 01:08:29.857
You like that, do you, huh?
You like it?

959
01:08:29.981 --> 01:08:32.325
Come here, you dirty little slut.

960
01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:34.991
Get off... get off me!

961
01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:38.914
No no!

962
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:40.867
- Come on, give us a kiss.
-  Get off!

963
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:42.918
Get off me!

964
01:08:43.119 --> 01:08:45.713
No!

965
01:08:57.383 --> 01:08:58.635
Get down there.

966
01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:25.836
Help me,

967
01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:51.146
Get off. Get off!

968
01:09:51.396 --> 01:09:52.648
Get off!

969
01:09:59.612 --> 01:10:01.990
Get up. Quick, get up.

970
01:10:02.407 --> 01:10:04.125
We need to move now.

971
01:10:06.494 --> 01:10:09.122
- What's going on?
- Shh.

972
01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:31.019
Daisy.

973
01:10:31.144 --> 01:10:33.772
I'm tired.

974
01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:36.074
My feet hurt.

975
01:10:37.108 --> 01:10:39.406
I need water!

976
01:10:39.986 --> 01:10:42.159
We've been walking for hours.

977
01:10:42.947 --> 01:10:44.199
I'm tired.

978
01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:46.409
- Daisy.
- Will you shut up?!

979
01:10:46.784 --> 01:10:51.460
I am so sick of your stupid,
whiny voice all the time.

980
01:10:51.789 --> 01:10:53.336
Do you want me to just
leave you here?

981
01:10:53.666 --> 01:10:55.213
Because that's what
I'm gonna do.

982
01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:57.428
If you don't shut the fuck up,

983
01:10:57.503 --> 01:10:58.425
I am gonna run,

984
01:10:58.504 --> 01:11:00.131
and you're gonna be
left here on your own

985
01:11:00.214 --> 01:11:01.966
in the dark and you're
gonna die out here.

986
01:11:03.134 --> 01:11:06.058
Do you wanna see
your brothers again?

987
01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:08.773
Well, come on.

988
01:11:33.206 --> 01:11:34.958
Piper.

989
01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:36.714
Piper!
What are you doing?

990
01:11:37.168 --> 01:11:38.385
It might be poison.

991
01:11:38.461 --> 01:11:40.805
- I forgot!
- Well, you can't forget, okay?

992
01:11:41.005 --> 01:11:43.224
If you don't know the source,
you can't trust the water.

993
01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:44.926
And you shouldn't have
eaten all that chocolate.

994
01:11:45.009 --> 01:11:46.477
That was stupid.

995
01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:49.813
Mommy says I'm a monster
for chocolates.

996
01:11:50.598 --> 01:11:52.441
I just can't help myself.

997
01:11:55.603 --> 01:11:57.901
Maybe that's why she went away.

998
01:11:58.022 --> 01:11:59.399
What?

999
01:12:00.358 --> 01:12:01.905
'Cause I was greedy.

1000
01:12:02.026 --> 01:12:03.869
What are you talking about?

1001
01:12:04.028 --> 01:12:06.656
'Cause she didn't want
to be around me anymore!

1002
01:12:14.247 --> 01:12:16.170
Hey.

1003
01:12:17.083 --> 01:12:20.178
Sometimes people say things
they don't mean.

1004
01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:22.338
Your mom loves you
more than anything.

1005
01:12:23.756 --> 01:12:25.508
And she's so proud of you.

1006
01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:28.094
- I know that for a fact.
- How?

1007
01:12:30.471 --> 01:12:33.350
Well, I'm older than you and...

1008
01:12:35.852 --> 01:12:37.820
it's just something I know.

1009
01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:40.573
And listen, about last night,

1010
01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:45.536
I'm sorry I said that stuff.
I didn't mean it, okay?

1011
01:12:48.155 --> 01:12:49.407
Come on.

1012
01:13:25.568 --> 01:13:27.787
<i>♪ Not because they're dirty ♪</i>

1013
01:13:27.904 --> 01:13:29.702
<i>♪ Not because they're clean ♪</i>

1014
01:13:29.947 --> 01:13:33.497
<i>♪ Not because I kissed
a boy behind a magazine ♪</i>

1015
01:13:33.618 --> 01:13:36.622
<i>♪ Boys, boys, having all the fun ♪</i>

1016
01:13:36.871 --> 01:13:39.080

1017
01:13:39.081 --> 01:13:40.754

1018
01:13:41.042 --> 01:13:43.261
<i>♪ She can't do this. ♪</i>

1019
01:13:46.339 --> 01:13:48.057
- Daisy?
- Hmm?

1020
01:13:48.174 --> 01:13:50.222
What was your mommy like?

1021
01:13:51.552 --> 01:13:53.646
I never really met her.

1022
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:55.102
How come?

1023
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:58.688
She died while I was being born.

1024
01:14:03.314 --> 01:14:04.861
Do you miss her?

1025
01:14:06.067 --> 01:14:07.569
Yeah,

1026
01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:09.199
sometimes.

1027
01:14:11.405 --> 01:14:13.874
If she'd never had me,
she'd probably still be alive.

1028
01:14:18.371 --> 01:14:21.170
Hey, come on.
We've got walking to do.

1029
01:14:24.251 --> 01:14:25.844
I hate walking.

1030
01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:31.764
When I get home,
I'm never going to walk again.

1031
01:14:47.358 --> 01:14:50.032
Look. Look!

1032
01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:53.326
That's the boys' place.

1033
01:14:53.531 --> 01:14:54.703
Gatesfield.

1034
01:14:54.782 --> 01:14:56.455
That's where they've
taken Eddie and Isaac.

1035
01:14:56.784 --> 01:14:59.253
I told you, they've gone home already.

1036
01:14:59.453 --> 01:15:02.252
But you're not sure.

1037
01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:04.425
Just 'cause you had a dream,

1038
01:15:04.542 --> 01:15:06.260
who says the dream's real?

1039
01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:14.852
Okay,

1040
01:15:14.927 --> 01:15:16.804
come on.

1041
01:15:16.929 --> 01:15:18.476
Yes. Come on.

1042
01:15:18.556 --> 01:15:20.775
As soon as I see
Eddie and Isaac,

1043
01:15:20.891 --> 01:15:23.235
I'm gonna give them a big hug.
Ah.

1044
01:15:35.781 --> 01:15:38.284
Where is everyone?

1045
01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:43.380
What was that?

1046
01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:53.632
Stay here, okay?

1047
01:17:33.691 --> 01:17:35.534
Are you here?

1048
01:17:38.028 --> 01:17:39.780
You'd better not be here.

1049
01:19:15.626 --> 01:19:16.878
sympathy of others.

1050
01:19:16.961 --> 01:19:18.884
Itching, rashes, water tablets.

1051
01:19:19.004 --> 01:19:21.006
Certain degree of willpower
and self-discipline.

1052
01:19:51.912 --> 01:19:54.415
- What was in there?
- Come on.

1053
01:19:54.707 --> 01:19:56.709
We need to get away from here.

1054
01:19:58.419 --> 01:20:00.046
Where are my brothers?

1055
01:20:01.672 --> 01:20:03.015
I don't know.

1056
01:20:06.427 --> 01:20:07.679
Come on.

1057
01:21:00.064 --> 01:21:01.941
Eddie.

1058
01:21:03.734 --> 01:21:05.236
Are you okay?

1059
01:21:11.575 --> 01:21:15.671
Can you just give me a sign
or something?

1060
01:21:20.501 --> 01:21:22.128
Eddie?

1061
01:21:47.486 --> 01:21:48.829
Ahh.

1062
01:21:53.826 --> 01:21:56.079
Don't worry.
It's not far now.

1063
01:21:57.121 --> 01:21:58.714
We should be home tomorrow.

1064
01:21:59.039 --> 01:22:00.632
Really?

1065
01:22:06.547 --> 01:22:08.800
I've saved a piece of chocolate.
Do you want it now?

1066
01:22:32.448 --> 01:22:33.574
Quick.

1067
01:22:34.491 --> 01:22:36.459
Go! Quick.

1068
01:22:47.921 --> 01:22:49.764
Come on, Piper! Come on!

1069
01:22:52.509 --> 01:22:53.931
Come on.

1070
01:22:54.011 --> 01:22:55.103
Quick.

1071
01:23:00.142 --> 01:23:01.985
Come on!

1072
01:23:06.899 --> 01:23:08.401
Come on.

1073
01:23:09.568 --> 01:23:10.990
Hurry up.

1074
01:23:14.239 --> 01:23:15.491
Come on.

1075
01:23:18.869 --> 01:23:19.995
In here.

1076
01:23:20.454 --> 01:23:21.421
Quick.

1077
01:23:47.898 --> 01:23:49.525
Oh, you're a big rabbit,
aren't you?

1078
01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:51.534
- Get off of me!
-  Hey.

1079
01:23:51.610 --> 01:23:54.238
- No! Get off!
- I'm not going to hurt you.

1080
01:23:54.947 --> 01:23:57.075
- Hey.
- Let her go!

1081
01:23:57.574 --> 01:23:59.292
I said let her go now!

1082
01:24:01.036 --> 01:24:02.583
What the fuck are you laughing at?

1083
01:24:03.539 --> 01:24:05.166
Don't move any closer.

1084
01:24:05.499 --> 01:24:07.797
We're only winding
you up, love, eh?

1085
01:24:09.503 --> 01:24:10.925
Come on, little lady.

1086
01:24:11.755 --> 01:24:13.132
It's just a bit of fun.

1087
01:24:15.384 --> 01:24:16.977
Don't you dare!

1088
01:24:20.597 --> 01:24:22.520
Take it easy now.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1089
01:24:22.766 --> 01:24:24.018
Calm down. Take it easy.

1090
01:24:24.101 --> 01:24:25.444
You don't have to do any...

1091
01:24:25.561 --> 01:24:26.653
Find a goal in life.

1092
01:24:26.728 --> 01:24:28.150
They stay in. Stop.
What is your problem?

1093
01:24:28.272 --> 01:24:30.400
What is your problem?

1094
01:24:30.983 --> 01:24:33.031
Hurry the fuck up.
Stay away from distractions.

1095
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:35.784
Take risks. Step out of your...
She almost got...

1096
01:24:38.031 --> 01:24:40.329
Accept life is unfair.
Focus on your goal.

1097
01:24:40.576 --> 01:24:44.171
- Oh God!
- That's for touching my cousin

1098
01:24:44.496 --> 01:24:47.295
with your dirty,
disgusting fingers!

1099
01:25:17.571 --> 01:25:19.448
The map.

1100
01:25:19.781 --> 01:25:20.828
Map.

1101
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:24.123
The compass.

1102
01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:26.088
The map.

1103
01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:28.674
The map. Oh shit.

1104
01:25:43.722 --> 01:25:45.440
I don't know where we are.

1105
01:26:56.294 --> 01:26:58.592
This seems like a nice place.

1106
01:26:59.506 --> 01:27:01.304
Why don't we just stay here?

1107
01:27:04.928 --> 01:27:06.100
Okay.

1108
01:27:13.103 --> 01:27:15.447
It doesn't matter if we just...

1109
01:27:15.731 --> 01:27:17.404
stay here.

1110
01:27:52.058 --> 01:27:54.356
It's Eddie's hawk. Look.

1111
01:28:00.066 --> 01:28:01.067
Come on.

1112
01:28:01.943 --> 01:28:03.115
Come on.

1113
01:28:12.078 --> 01:28:13.751
It's taking us home.

1114
01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:15.423
I told you, didn't I?

1115
01:28:16.333 --> 01:28:17.585
Eddie's home.

1116
01:29:54.097 --> 01:29:56.065
Maybe they're at the barn.

1117
01:30:11.072 --> 01:30:12.915
Eddie?

1118
01:30:17.954 --> 01:30:19.046
Jet!

1119
01:30:19.122 --> 01:30:21.250
Jet. Daisy, it's Jet.

1120
01:30:21.541 --> 01:30:24.169
Oh, Jet!

1121
01:30:24.252 --> 01:30:25.754
Oh, I love you, Jet.

1122
01:30:29.841 --> 01:30:31.218
Look at me, Jet.

1123
01:30:31.384 --> 01:30:32.510
You're bleeding.

1124
01:30:32.719 --> 01:30:34.721
What happened? Look at me.

1125
01:30:36.181 --> 01:30:38.684
And I will never let you go.

1126
01:32:15.739 --> 01:32:17.366
What's up with him?

1127
01:32:25.832 --> 01:32:27.175
He's in the woods.

1128
01:32:27.792 --> 01:32:29.089
Daisy!

1129
01:32:29.169 --> 01:32:30.546
Daisy, be careful!

1130
01:33:18.510 --> 01:33:20.012
Eddie?

1131
01:33:20.804 --> 01:33:22.147
Can you hear me?

1132
01:33:25.266 --> 01:33:26.609
Eddie.

1133
01:33:27.644 --> 01:33:29.146
I need you.

1134
01:33:29.229 --> 01:33:30.481
Please.

1135
01:33:32.315 --> 01:33:34.192
I love you.

1136
01:33:34.609 --> 01:33:36.486
Please.

1137
01:33:40.698 --> 01:33:41.950
Eddie?

1138
01:33:42.117 --> 01:33:43.585
It's me.

1139
01:33:45.370 --> 01:33:46.747
Eddie?

1140
01:33:46.913 --> 01:33:48.540
Eddie, it's okay.

1141
01:33:48.748 --> 01:33:50.591
It's me.

1142
01:33:52.877 --> 01:33:55.346
You're home.

1143
01:33:57.674 --> 01:33:59.472
You're home.

1144
01:34:24.325 --> 01:34:25.372
Before the war,

1145
01:34:25.451 --> 01:34:27.874
I used my willpower
for stupid stuff,

1146
01:34:28.121 --> 01:34:29.714
like not eating chocolate.

1147
01:34:35.670 --> 01:34:38.549
I think I thought
if I could control myself,

1148
01:34:38.923 --> 01:34:42.143
then maybe the world around me
would start to make sense.

1149
01:34:44.596 --> 01:34:46.690
I guess I was
pretty naive back then.

1150
01:34:59.068 --> 01:35:00.945
During the war we all learned

1151
01:35:01.029 --> 01:35:03.782
to stop looking for reasons
why things happen.

1152
01:35:09.996 --> 01:35:11.794
We don't know
what happened to Eddie,

1153
01:35:12.916 --> 01:35:14.543
what he saw...

1154
01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:17.428
the things he had to do.

1155
01:35:19.797 --> 01:35:21.799
His burns and scars
are starting to heal,

1156
01:35:22.926 --> 01:35:24.928
but he hasn't spoken.

1157
01:35:25.011 --> 01:35:26.729
...announcing earlier today

1158
01:35:26.804 --> 01:35:29.148
that a runway at heathrow
is due to reopen.

1159
01:35:29.224 --> 01:35:31.477
The airport will be
working at 10% capacity.

1160
01:35:31.643 --> 01:35:33.145
Officials have also revealed

1161
01:35:33.228 --> 01:35:35.356
that since the ceasefire
was announced,

1162
01:35:35.438 --> 01:35:37.532
electricity services
have returned to normal

1163
01:35:37.607 --> 01:35:39.450
in parts of the south.

1164
01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:42.366
The new government estimates
that within three months,

1165
01:35:42.445 --> 01:35:45.949
80% of the country should have
returned to pre-war levels.

1166
01:35:46.032 --> 01:35:48.706
Rail services are currently
operating at 15%.

1167
01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:57.589
Isaac's gone, isn't he?

1168
01:36:13.434 --> 01:36:15.653
Will Eddie be okay?

1169
01:36:16.688 --> 01:36:18.907
Yeah, he'll be okay.

1170
01:36:20.316 --> 01:36:22.239
He just needs time.

1171
01:36:56.019 --> 01:36:57.441
Now I use my willpower

1172
01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:00.615
to wait for you, Eddie,
to care for you

1173
01:37:01.065 --> 01:37:02.612
and love you.

1174
01:37:04.610 --> 01:37:07.614
I have to believe that one day
you're going to get better.

1175
01:37:14.078 --> 01:37:16.001
Did you finish your drink?

1176
01:37:20.209 --> 01:37:22.928
"Yes, thank you, Daisy.
It was lovely."

1177
01:37:27.592 --> 01:37:29.594
- Oh!

1178
01:37:29.927 --> 01:37:32.021
Ow.
Does it hurt?

1179
01:38:07.173 --> 01:38:08.220
'Cause like I said to you

1180
01:38:08.299 --> 01:38:10.017
all that time ago,

1181
01:38:10.385 --> 01:38:12.308
if the world doesn't end,

1182
01:38:13.137 --> 01:38:14.389
I wanna be here

1183
01:38:14.514 --> 01:38:15.982
at home,

1184
01:38:16.057 --> 01:38:17.684
with you.

1185
01:38:18.518 --> 01:38:20.191
And that's how I live now.
