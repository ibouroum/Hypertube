1
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.845
Start simple.
Start with what you know is true.

2
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.967
My name is Katniss Everdeen.
My home is District 12.

3
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.291
I was in the Hunger Games. I escaped.

4
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.487
Peeta... Peeta was left behind.

5
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.965
Miss Everdeen?

6
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.451
You can't be in here.

7
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.328
I had a nightmare. Just five more minutes.

8
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.286
You need to sleep. We can help you sleep.

9
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.170
Just five more minutes.

10
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.041
No.

11
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.130
No, please, don't. It's just five more...

12
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.524
Don't touch me! Don't!
No! Get off of me!

13
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.131
Finnick.

14
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.643
I wanted to go back for Peeta and Johanna,

15
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.365
but I couldn't move.

16
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.083
They have Annie, too. They took her.

17
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.720
She's in the Capitol.

18
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.689
I wish she was dead.

19
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.004
I wish they were all dead and we were, too.

20
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.245
Miss Everdeen.

21
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.330
Colonel Boggs,
District 13's head of security.

22
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.331
I know you've been discharged,

23
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.761
but President Coin's
requested to meet with you first.

24
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.764
Is there any news?

25
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.883
I'm just here to escort you.

26
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.810
We were always told
there was nothing left of 13.

27
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.481
Capitol bombed the surface to rubble.

28
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.963
But we're military,
so we learned to survive down here.

29
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.524
Preparing, training.

30
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.245
The war never stopped for us.

31
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.731
There she is.

32
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.050
Our Girl on Fire.

33
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.046
Madam President, may I present you with
The Mockingjay.

34
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.487
What an honor it is to meet you.

35
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.526
You're a courageous young woman.

36
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.286
I know how disorienting this must be.

37
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.088
And I can't imagine what it's like to
live through the atrocities of those Games.

38
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.370
Katniss, President Alma Coin.

39
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.210
Please know how welcome you are.

40
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.927
I hope you'll find some comfort with us.

41
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.407
We've known loss in 13, too.

42
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.568
This is history. Right here at this table.

43
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.120
I apologize.
I wish you had more time to recover,

44
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.009
but unfortunately, we don't have that luxury.

45
00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.445
Please, have a seat.

46
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.086
Are you aware of what's happened?

47
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.245
When you fired your arrow at the force field

48
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.248
you electrified the nation.

49
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.128
There have been riots and uprisings
and strikes in seven districts.

50
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.121
We believe that if we keep this energy going

51
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.851
we can unify the districts
against the Capitol.

52
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.646
But if we don't, if we let it dissipate,

53
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.805
we could be waiting another 75 years
for this opportunity.

54
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.122
Everyone in 13 is ready for this.

55
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.049
What about Peeta? Is he alive?

56
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.090
I don't know. And I wish that I did.

57
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.208
But there's no way for me to contact
my operatives inside the Capitol.

58
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.966
The Capitol has always suppressed
communication between the districts.

59
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.808
But I know their system very well.
I managed to break through.

60
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.162
All we need now is the perfect message.

61
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.568
Katniss, here's what we need to do.

62
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.405
We need to show them
that The Mockingjay's alive and well

63
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.245
and willing to stand up and join this fight.

64
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.244
'Cause we need every district
to stand up to this Capitol.

65
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.925
The way you did.

66
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.807
So we're gonna shoot
a series of propaganda clips,

67
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.010
Propos, I like to call them,
on The Mockingjay.

68
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.730
Spreads the word that
we're gonna stoke the fire of this rebellion.

69
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.447
The fire that The Mockingjay started.

70
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.331
You left him there.

71
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.284
You left Peeta in that arena to die.

72
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.327
Katniss, there are so many...

73
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.209
Peeta was the one
who was supposed to live.

74
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.281
Miss Everdeen.

75
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.082
This revolution is about everyone.
It's about all of us.

76
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.851
And we need a voice.

77
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.009
Then you should've saved Peeta.

78
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.842
Maybe you should have
rescued the boy instead.

79
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.566
No.

80
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.484
No, listen to me.
No one else can do this but her.

81
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.210
This is not the girl you described.

82
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.526
Obviously, we need to make it personal.

83
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.450
Remind her who the real enemy is.

84
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.329
She knows who the enemy is.
That's not the issue.

85
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.845
Unless she's forgotten.

86
00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.243
There's explaining and there's showing.

87
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.327
Let her see what the Capitol did to 12.

88
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.611
She can't handle it.
The Games destroyed her.

89
00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.888
This is the only choice you have.

90
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.969
People don't always show up
the way you want them to, Madam President.

91
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.851
But that anger, that anger-driven defiance,

92
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.241
that's what we want. And we can redirect it.

93
00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.329
We need to unite these people out there

94
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.483
that have been doing nothing
but killing each other in an arena for years.

95
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.048
We have to have a lightning rod.

96
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.449
They'll follow her.
She's the face of the revolution.

97
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.649
Let her see it. Let her go home.

98
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.761
Send her.

99
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.564
I can't believe
you're going through with this.

100
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.485
You can say "no."

101
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.444
I need to see it for myself.

102
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.326
This way.

103
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.000
13 swept everything,
top to bottom so you'd be safe.

104
00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.122
You sure you don't want me to go with you?

105
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.041
Yeah. I'm sure.

106
00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.808
We'll have our eyes on you from above.

107
00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.730
Figures.

108
00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.161
Hey!

109
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.606
Come on.

110
00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.041
Don't you wanna see Prim?

111
00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.922
There you go. You're breakin' my heart.

112
00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.610
Egeria

113
00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.244
We need to fix these lines.

114
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.363
I won't say "rebels."

115
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.844
These are senseless acts of defiance.

116
00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.969
And I won't legitimize them.

117
00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.245
We'll call them "criminals."

118
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.401
"Radicals."

119
00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.041
Otherwise we're breaking my oldest rule.

120
00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.891
Never let them see you bleed.

121
00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.284
Citizens,

122
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:10.121
tonight I address all of Panem as one.

123
00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.408
<i>Since the Dark Days,</i>

124
00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.401
<i>Panem has had
an unprecedented era of peace.</i>

125
00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.169
<i>It is a peace built upon cooperation.</i>

126
00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.324
<i>And a respect for law and order.</i>

127
00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.246
<i>In the past weeks,
you have heard of sporadic violence</i>

128
00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:33.247
<i>following the actions of a few radicals
in the Quarter Quell.</i>

129
00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.884
<i>Those who choose this destructive path,</i>

130
00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.886
<i>your actions are based on
a misunderstanding</i>

131
00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:43.567
<i>of how we have survived- Together.</i>

132
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.123
<i>It is a contract.</i>

133
00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:51.926
<i>Each district supplies the Capitol.
Like blood to a heart.</i>

134
00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:57.367
<i>In return,
the Capitol provides order and security.</i>

135
00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.169
<i>To refuse work</i>

136
00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.282
<i>is to put the entire system in danger.</i>

137
00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.282
<i>The Capitol is the beating heart of Panem.</i>

138
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.080
<i>Nothing can survive without a heart.</i>

139
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.962
<i>The criminals that kneel before you</i>

140
00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.970
<i>use symbols for the purpose of sedition.</i>

141
00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.967
Which is why all images of The Mockingjay

142
00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.320
are now forbidden.

143
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.531
Possessing them
will be considered treason.

144
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.923
Punishable by death.

145
00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.800
Justice shall be served swiftly.

146
00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.960
<i>Order shall be restored.</i>

147
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.884
<i>To those who ignore
the warnings of history,</i>

148
00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.685
<i>prepare to pay the ultimate price.</i>

149
00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.849
It's okay. We're okay.

150
00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.850
We're all here now.

151
00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.367
Buttercup!

152
00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.885
I smuggled him in.

153
00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.411
I got Dad.

154
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.446
And I got some of your herbs
from the kitchen.

155
00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.242
They have strict rules.

156
00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.126
I don't know what they'll do
if they find him here.

157
00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.406
You should try to eat something.

158
00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:41.566
<i>Hello. Good evening.
And a big welcome to all in Panem.</i>

159
00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.410
<i>I'm Caesar Flickerman.</i>

160
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.126
<i>And whoever you are,
whatever it is you're doing,</i>

161
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.725
<i>if you're working, put down your work.</i>

162
00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.604
<i>If you're having dinner, stop having dinner.</i>

163
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.561
<i>Because you are going to
want to witness this tonight.</i>

164
00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.363
<i>There has been rampant speculation</i>

165
00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.808
<i>about what really happened
in the Quarter Quell.</i>

166
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.403
<i>And here to shed a little light on the subject
for us is a very special guest.</i>

167
00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:08.281
<i>Please welcome Mr. Peeta Mellark.</i>

168
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:14.571
<i>Peeta, a lot of people
feel as though they are in the dark.</i>

169
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.768
<i>Yeah, I know how they feel.</i>

170
00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.970
<i>Now, so set the stage for us.</i>

171
00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.964
<i>Talk us through what really happened</i>

172
00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.601
<i>on that final and controversial night.</i>

173
00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:29.130
<i>First off; you have to understand
that when you're in the Games</i>

174
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.971
<i>you only get one wish. It's very costly.</i>

175
00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:34.127
You're alive.

176
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.247
<i>It costs your life.</i>

177
00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.526
<i>I think it costs more than your life.</i>

178
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.170
<i>How do you mean?
What's more than your life?</i>

179
00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:42.609
<i>I mean to murder innocent people,
that costs everything that you are.</i>

180
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.846
<i>Yes.</i>

181
00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.043
<i>So you hold on to that one wish.</i>

182
00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.320
<i>And that night my wish was to save Katniss.</i>

183
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.526
<i>Yes.</i>

184
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.850
<i>I should've just run off with her
earlier in the day like she'd wanted.</i>

185
00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:59.562
<i>But you didn't. Why?
Were you caught up in Beetee's plan?</i>

186
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.970
<i>No, I was caught up trying to play allies.</i>

187
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.524
<i>And then they separated us</i>

188
00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.001
<i>and that's when I lost her.</i>

189
00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.604
<i>And then the lightning hit</i>

190
00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.521
<i>and the whole force field around the arena
just blew out.</i>

191
00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:21.562
<i>Yes, but, Peeta,
Katniss is the one who blew it out.</i>

192
00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:22.607
<i>No.</i>

193
00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:23.681
<i>You saw the footage.</i>

194
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.041
<i>No, she didn't know what she was doing.</i>

195
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.841
<i>Neither of us knew there was
a bigger plan going on. We had no idea.</i>

196
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.001
<i>- You had no idea?
- No.</i>

197
00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:35.881
<i>All right. Well, Peeta, there are many
who find this suspicious to say the least.</i>

198
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.005
<i>It seems as though
she was part of a rebel plan.</i>

199
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.449
<i>Do you think it was part of her plan
to be almost killed by Johanna?</i>

200
00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.766
<i>Or part of the plan
to be paralyzed by lightning?</i>

201
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.249
<i>No, we were not part of any rebel plan.
We had no idea what was going on.</i>

202
00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:55.206
<i>All right. I believe you, Peeta Mellark.
Thank you.</i>

203
00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.327
Yeah.

204
00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.641
<i>And I was going to ask you to speak
about the unrest</i>

205
00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.041
<i>but I think you might be too upset.</i>

206
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.526
<i>No, I can.</i>

207
00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.329
<i>- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.</i>

208
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.561
<i>Thank you.</i>

209
00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:13.922
<i>I want everyone who's watching to stop</i>

210
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.209
<i>and to think about
what a civil war could mean.</i>

211
00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.608
<i>We almost went extinct once before.</i>

212
00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.729
<i>And now our numbers are even fewer.</i>

213
00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:22.801
He's one of them.

214
00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.006
<i>Is this really what we wanna do?</i>

215
00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.081
He's a traitor.

216
00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.400
<i>Kill ourselves off?</i>

217
00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.602
<i>Killing is not the answer.</i>

218
00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.364
I can't believe he's doing this.

219
00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.409
<i>Everyone needs to
Ia y down their weapons immediately.</i>

220
00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.126
Traitor!

221
00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.765
He's not one of us!

222
00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.405
This is treason!

223
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.287
<i>Are you calling for a ceasefire?</i>

224
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.043
Yeah. <i>I</i> am.

225
00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.246
You're a puppet!

226
00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.446
Hang him!

227
00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.251
<i>I want everyone to stop
the senseless violence.</i>

228
00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.890
<i>This is not the path to change.</i>

229
00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.200
Traitor!

230
00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.124
<i>It's not the path to justice.</i>

231
00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.248
There can't be a ceasefire.

232
00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.162
Not after everything Snow's done.

233
00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.642
He could have done a lot of damage tonight.

234
00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:31.407
Most districts, people are still
too afraid to join. They need the courage.

235
00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.085
Why do you think he said that?

236
00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.364
I don't know. Maybe he was forced.

237
00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.483
He didn't look that bad.

238
00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.167
Maybe he made some kind of deal
to protect you.

239
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.243
He's still playing the game.

240
00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.645
No!No!No!

241
00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.169
I'm sorry. It's just a nightmare.

242
00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.049
That's okay. I get 'em, too.

243
00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.687
Peeta,

244
00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.291
will you stay with me?

245
00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.360
Yeah.

246
00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.721
Always.

247
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.526
<i>Hey-</i>

248
00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.245
Can't sleep?

249
00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.605
Tell me what's happening.

250
00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.684
I'm good at keeping secrets.

251
00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:17.966
Even from Mom.

252
00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.287
No one hates the Capitol more than me.

253
00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.963
And I wanna help. But I just keep thinking

254
00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.364
even if we win this war,
what happens to Peeta?

255
00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.289
I know he's not safe there,
but he's definitely not safe here.

256
00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.770
I don't think you know
how important you are to them.

257
00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.963
If you want something, you just have to ask.

258
00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:55.249
You could demand almost anything.
They'd have to agree to it.

259
00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.891
I should wake you up
more often, Little Duck.

260
00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.925
Get some sleep now.

261
00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.641
You, too.

262
00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.523
<i>Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.</i>

263
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.487
I've decided I'll be your Mockingjay.

264
00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.970
But I have some conditions.

265
00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:31.410
Peeta and the other Tributes,
Johanna Mason and Annie Cresta,

266
00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.007
will be rescued at the earliest opportunity.

267
00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.282
If and when Peeta is liberated,

268
00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.000
he will receive
a full and unconditional pardon.

269
00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:43.284
No punishment will be inflicted.
And the same goes for the other Tributes.

270
00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.847
No.

271
00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.286
It's not their fault
you abandoned them in the arena.

272
00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.961
They're doing and saying
whatever they can to survive.

273
00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.407
Individuals don't make demands in 13.

274
00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.809
There will be a tribunal. And a fair judgment.

275
00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.760
Thank you.

276
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.328
The Victors will be granted immunity.

277
00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.802
And you will announce that
in front of the entire population of 13.

278
00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:12.611
You will hold yourself
and your government responsible

279
00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.047
or you will find another Mockingjay.

280
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.771
That's it. That's her. Right there.

281
00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:20.210
Isn't that who I promised you?

282
00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:24.764
She wears the costume.
Gunfire in the background. A hint of smoke.

283
00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.685
Our Mockingjay.

284
00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.567
Madam President, we're losing ground,
because the people are losing heart.

285
00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.650
This is worth the risk. She's worth the risk.

286
00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.320
Pardons, tribunals. Power of the people.

287
00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.926
It can all be the bedrock
of the new Panem, but,

288
00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:45.522
in wartime I think even the noblest of causes
can be bent a little bit. Right?

289
00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.607
Do you have any other conditions?

290
00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.003
My sister gets to keep her cat.

291
00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.601
Go away.

292
00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.563
Is it visiting hours again?

293
00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.361
Miss Trinket,

294
00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.610
you see this door.

295
00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.800
It opens. From the inside.

296
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.483
I've told you, these are the standard
living quarters. Same as everyone.

297
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.645
You're not a prisoner.
You're free to join the rest of 13.

298
00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:45.161
Not looking like this. Thank you very much.

299
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.720
We have a bigger issue
than wardrobe, Miss Trinket.

300
00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.049
Katniss has agreed to be The Mockingjay.

301
00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.601
That poor thing.

302
00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.160
And your Girl on Fire is burnt out.

303
00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.448
I need you to join this team now.

304
00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.770
I need someone she trusts.

305
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.365
What about Haymitch?

306
00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:03.491
He's drying out in some facility a mile down.

307
00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:07.247
Aiding rebels is not really my forte.

308
00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:11.723
Miss Trinket,
your days in the Capitol are over,

309
00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.610
no matter what happens here.

310
00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.605
If you wanna play a prisoner of war, fine.

311
00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.484
Stay here and rot.

312
00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.887
I'll find someone else
to be The Mockingjay's escort.

313
00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.161
Who?

314
00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.843
Anyone can be replaced.

315
00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.770
Not your Mockingjay.

316
00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:39.687
There isn't a soul in this dungeon
who knows the first thing about Katniss.

317
00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:46.922
You honestly believe one of these
cave dwellers is going to take my place?

318
00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.086
No.

319
00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.691
Good afternoon.

320
00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.687
Thank you for interrupting your schedules.

321
00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.882
<i>They have already been adjusted
to compensate for the delay.</i>

322
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.530
I hardly ever see children around here.

323
00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.762
<i>Please, check in with your unit supervisors
when you resume work.</i>

324
00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.571
A lot of them were lost in an epidemic
a few years ago.

325
00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.011
<i>I have an announcement
for the citizens of 13.</i>

326
00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.491
Coin lost her family, too.

327
00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.485
Daughter and a husband.

328
00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.922
<i>And our welcome guests from 12.</i>

329
00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:32.251
Katniss Everdeen has consented to be
the face of our cause

330
00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:36.089
to help unite the districts
against the Capitol.

331
00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:42.091
In exchange,
I have promised several concessions.

332
00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:47.608
First, we'll assess all opportunities
for the extraction of the Victors

333
00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.368
held hostage in the Capitol.

334
00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.646
Peeta Mellark,

335
00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.450
Johanna Mason...

336
00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.485
Finnick, I made the deal for Annie, too.

337
00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.449
...and Annie Cresta.

338
00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:06.889
Once freed, they will be granted full pardon
for any and all crimes

339
00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.281
committed against the rebel cause.

340
00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.007
Good.

341
00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.449
That's good, Katniss.

342
00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:20.525
If Katniss Everdeen fails to fulfill her duties

343
00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.484
the deal will be off.

344
00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:27.328
Thank you for your attention.
Please, resume your daily schedules.

345
00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.167
Madam President.

346
00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.480
Effie Trinket.

347
00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.086
Welcome to 13.

348
00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:38.410
Madam President, may I say you are so very

349
00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.810
concise.

350
00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.164
You believe that there's more to be said?

351
00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:44.767
May I speak freely?

352
00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.723
You don't appear to do anything else.

353
00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.091
I'm only talking about salesmanship.

354
00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.128
The thing with revolutions,
they're a tender flame.

355
00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:58.524
They need to be nurtured
with a little kindling and warmth.

356
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.161
Bit of oxygen.

357
00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.611
0xygen.

358
00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.527
One sure way to put it out is to smother it.

359
00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.241
Or to use up all the air in the room.

360
00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:08.880
Excuse me.

361
00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:15.247
You know what could use a revolution?
That hair.

362
00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.721
Effie?

363
00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.085
What are you doing here?

364
00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.884
I'm a political refugee.

365
00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.686
Plutarch rescued you?

366
00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.968
Rescued, yes, that's what he calls it.

367
00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.166
You and I were both in the dark.

368
00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:36.921
Now I'm condemned to
this life of jumpsuits.

369
00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:40.361
It is wonderful to see you again.

370
00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.931
Can you believe this place?

371
00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.804
I miss coffee.

372
00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.441
I never knew anyplace could be so strict.

373
00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:56.249
I mean, I thought at least in the higher ranks
there'd be some

374
00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.890
side action.

375
00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.930
I miss my wigs.

376
00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.687
Luckily, I remembered that
this was all the rage when I was coming up.

377
00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:08.089
You know,
everything old can be made new again.

378
00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:10.651
Like democracy.

379
00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.369
Which brings me to this.

380
00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:24.761
Cinna.

381
00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.965
He's dead, isn't he?

382
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.931
Yes, dear.

383
00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:40.565
He made Plutarch promise
not to show you this

384
00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:43.610
until you'd decided to be The Mockingjay
on your own.

385
00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.283
He knew the risks. As we all do.

386
00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.328
He believed in this revolution.

387
00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.565
He believed in you.

388
00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.370
They're beautiful.

389
00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.291
They have it.

390
00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.922
They have the Mockingjay outfit.

391
00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:11.244
There's not much of a prep team here in 13
but we will make you

392
00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:15.411
the best-dressed rebel in history.

393
00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:20.806
Okay.

394
00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.321
Bring up the lights.

395
00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:43.165
Cinna's final touch.

396
00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:50.928
Everyone's either gonna wanna
kiss you, kill you,

397
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.525
or be you.

398
00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.640
<i>Perfect.</i>

399
00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.851
<i>Absolutely perfect.</i>

400
00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:59.606
Okay. Let's bring up the setting.

401
00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.366
<i>Little Wind.</i>

402
00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.410
<i>Okay, Katniss, we're gonna start you
down on one knee.</i>

403
00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.369
- Okay.
- And as you <i>rise</i> up,

404
00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:17.524
<i>you're gonna hold your flag in the air
and deliver your line.</i>

405
00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.726
<i>And remember you've just stormed
the outskirts of the Capitol</i>

406
00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.325
<i>arm-in-arm with your brothers and sisters.</i>

407
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.001
Okay.

408
00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.567
<i>Whenever you're ready.</i>

409
00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:35.082
People of Panem, we fight, we dare, we...

410
00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:38.807
<i>Does she know the line?</i>

411
00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.644
I know it. I got it. I'm sorry.

412
00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:41.926
- Let's do <i>it</i> again.
- She's warming up.

413
00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:45.285
<i>All right. With energy. Go.</i>

414
00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:47.804
People of Panem, we fight!

415
00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:51.726
We dare to end this hunger for justice!

416
00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.004
<i>You've just been in battle!</i>

417
00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:57.330
<i>I'm sorry. Excuse my outburst.</i>

418
00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:00.006
<i>You've just been in battle.</i>

419
00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:01.926
Let's try it again.

420
00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:03.446
Whenever you're ready.

421
00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.808
People of Panem, we fight!

422
00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:11.568
We dare to end this hunger for justice.

423
00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:26.485
And that, my friends,
is how a revolution dies.

424
00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.650
Hello, Katniss.

425
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.884
This how you greet an old friend?

426
00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.607
Maybe I don't recognize you sober.

427
00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.611
I guess it looks as bad as it feels.

428
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.451
<i>People of Panem, we fight!</i>

429
00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:53.286
<i>We dare! We end this hunger for justice!</i>

430
00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:08.887
Madam President, indulge me for a moment,
if you would.

431
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.480
Let's everybody think of one incident

432
00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:14.570
where Katniss Everdeen
genuinely moved you.

433
00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:19.887
Not where you were jealous of her hairstyle
or her dress went up in flames

434
00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:23.044
or she made a halfway decent shot
with an arrow.

435
00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.766
And not where Peeta made you like her.

436
00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:29.406
No, I'd like you all to think of one moment

437
00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.926
where she made you feel something real.

438
00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:37.484
When she volunteered
for her sister at the Reaping.

439
00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:40.009
Excellent example.

440
00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:41.841
Okay.

441
00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:44.409
I hope that wasn't important.

442
00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:49.570
Okay. "Volunteer for sister."

443
00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:51.449
Good. What else?

444
00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:54.205
When she sang that song for little Rue.

445
00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:57.725
Oh, yeah. Who didn't get choked up at that?

446
00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:01.045
You know, I like you better, Effie,
without all that makeup.

447
00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.964
Well, I like you better sober.

448
00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.368
When she chose Rue as an ally, as well.

449
00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:07.726
Yes.

450
00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.806
Now, what do all these have in common?

451
00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:12.610
No one told her what to do.

452
00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.765
Unscripted, yes.

453
00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:17.085
So maybe we should just leave her alone.

454
00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.486
And wash her face.

455
00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.402
She's still a girl. You made her look 35.

456
00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:26.525
The opportunities for spontaneity
are obviously lacking below ground.

457
00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:30.930
So what you're suggesting
is we toss her into combat?

458
00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:35.810
I can't sanction putting an untrained civilian
in battle just for effect.

459
00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.445
This is not the Capitol.

460
00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.370
That is exactly what I'm suggesting.
Put her in the field.

461
00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.646
No, we can't protect her.

462
00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:45.327
It has to come from her.
That's what people respond to.

463
00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:48.085
You want a symbol for the revolution?

464
00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.481
She cannot be coached into it.
Trust me, I know.

465
00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.842
Maybe there's someplace
that's less dangerous.

466
00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:55.321
District 8.
They reported heavy bombing last week.

467
00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:56.607
There are no military targets left.

468
00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.166
We can't guarantee her safety.

469
00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:00.163
You'll never be able to guarantee my safety.

470
00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:02.841
I wanna go.

471
00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:04.531
And if you're killed?

472
00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.764
Make sure you get it on camera.

473
00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.842
I've made you some surprises.

474
00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.610
Maybe you wanna try one out.

475
00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.890
If you're gonna be
a part of Katniss' Propo team,

476
00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.610
you may as well look the part.

477
00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:44.521
And this one is for you.

478
00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:50.124
Plutarch wanted you to have a weapon
for the sake of the propos

479
00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:53.687
but I couldn't just make you
a fashion accessory.

480
00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:58.125
It's beautiful.

481
00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.204
And look here.

482
00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:10.928
Regular. Incendiary. Explosive arrows.

483
00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.366
All color-coded.

484
00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:18.166
And tell Finnick I've got a trident for him

485
00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:19.926
when he's ready.

486
00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.486
Might just cheer him up.

487
00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:29.401
Let's not fire the red ones in here.

488
00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:50.881
You had all of this and you just
left the districts to fend for themselves?

489
00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:55.364
It's not that simple, Katniss.
We barely survived.

490
00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:58.486
We weren't in any kind of shape
to launch a counterattack.

491
00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.526
Yeah, we could've bombed the Capitol

492
00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.921
but they would've retaliated
with at least twice the firepower.

493
00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.326
Then what?

494
00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:08.201
There would've been nobody left
to claim victory.

495
00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:12.247
Sounds like exactly what Peeta said
and then you all called him a traitor.

496
00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:16.850
This way, soldier.

497
00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:20.482
You are camera-ready.

498
00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.882
Doesn't your comrade look handsome?

499
00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.001
Let's go.

500
00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.920
Come back safe.

501
00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.928
Quick introductions, Katniss.

502
00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:39.841
These people have come a long way
to support the cause.

503
00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:40.921
This is Cressida.

504
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.209
In my opinion one of the best
up-and-coming directors in the Capitol.

505
00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:46.647
Until I up and left. Hey.

506
00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:48.007
<i>Hey-</i>

507
00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.288
Let's see what you can do.
All right. Be careful.

508
00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.724
This is my assistant, Messalla.

509
00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.525
It's an honor to meet you.

510
00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.648
And your cameramen over there, Castor.

511
00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:58.721
Hello.

512
00:41:58.880 --> 00:41:59.927
And Pollux.

513
00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.291
Let's get locked in.

514
00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.686
You're all from the Capitol?

515
00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.006
Plutarch got you out?

516
00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:16.003
Don't expect much chitchat from him.

517
00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:19.369
He's an Avox.
Capitol cut his tongue out years ago.

518
00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:24.523
And, no, it wasn't any sort of rescue,
if that's what you mean.

519
00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.723
We all fled on our own.

520
00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:29.280
For this.

521
00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:30.961
For you.

522
00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.842
This has gotta be fast. In and out.

523
00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:24.326
Move out.

524
00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.448
You're alive then. We weren't sure.

525
00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:40.522
Katniss, Commander Paylor, District 8.

526
00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.364
Katniss has been recovering,
but she insisted on coming out

527
00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:43.566
and seein' some of your wounded.

528
00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:45.045
Well, we've got plenty of those.

529
00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:57.960
We have a mass grave
a few blocks west, but,

530
00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:00.407
I can't spare the manpower
to move them yet.

531
00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.963
Hospital's past that curtain.

532
00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.242
Any hope you can give them, it's worth it.

533
00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:08.444
The Capitol's done everything they can
to break us.

534
00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.127
Aren't you worried about
having all your wounded in one place?

535
00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.924
I think it's better than leaving them to die.

536
00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.081
That's not what I meant.

537
00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.248
Well, that's my only other option.

538
00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:20.081
You can come up with another, I'm all ears.

539
00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:22.331
It's right through here.

540
00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:38.043
Don't film me in there. I can't help them.

541
00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:41.449
Just let them see your face.

542
00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:59.041
Excuse me.

543
00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.850
Yeah. You all right?

544
00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.045
It's okay. Here, it's okay.

545
00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:11.963
I've got you. It's all right.

546
00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.050
Katniss Everdeen?

547
00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.964
What are you doing here?

548
00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:53.449
I came to see you.

549
00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:57.170
What about the baby?

550
00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:04.001
I lost it.

551
00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:05.765
Are you fighting, Katniss?

552
00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:10.205
You here to fight with us?

553
00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:12.846
I am.

554
00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:15.846
I will.

555
00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:37.121
Tighter.

556
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.206
Tighter, tighter.

557
00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:51.771
Sir, some cameras were damaged
in the bombings,

558
00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:55.083
but we confirmed it's her.

559
00:46:58.560 --> 00:46:59.721
Zoom in.

560
00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:11.402
She was visiting a makeshift hospital.
We're not sure if she's still there.

561
00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:17.560
We can scramble hovercraft
from the border of 11.

562
00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:19.563
We may be able to target her.

563
00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.411
Kill the wounded.

564
00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:24.931
Sir...

565
00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:28.721
You wrote that speech yourself, Egeria.

566
00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:34.847
Any association with the Mockingjay symbol
is forbidden.

567
00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:39.642
Everyone inside that hospital
has committed treason.

568
00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:46.283
Show them what it costs
to be friends with Katniss Everdeen.

569
00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.041
Your mom's gonna be proud of you
when she sees the footage.

570
00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.131
Will this play in the districts?

571
00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:53.402
It'll be tattooed on their eyes.

572
00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:55.810
There's a problem.

573
00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:57.281
What kinda problem?

574
00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:59.644
Incoming bombers from the north.

575
00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:01.526
We need to find cover now.

576
00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:02.806
There's a bunker in there.

577
00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:18.290
Straight ahead and down the stairs.

578
00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:21.161
Katniss!

579
00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:23.006
Katniss!

580
00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:27.643
Everdeen! Everdeen!

581
00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:30.170
Gale, back away from the wall!

582
00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.281
You Okay?

583
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.161
Move!

584
00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:04.250
They're going after something to the south.

585
00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:05.646
That's towards the hospital.

586
00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:12.561
They're circling back around. Come on!

587
00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:54.490
That's the hospital.
They're targeting the hospital.

588
00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:53.001
Help them! Help them! Get them out!

589
00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:56.971
Katniss?

590
00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:00.610
Katniss, can you tell everyone
what you're seeing right now?

591
00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.849
Katniss, what do you wanna say?

592
00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:18.761
I want the rebels to know that I'm alive.

593
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.843
That I'm in District 8

594
00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:24.890
where the Capitol just bombed a hospital

595
00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:29.529
filled with unarmed men,
women and children.

596
00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:32.049
And there will be no survivors.

597
00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:39.161
If you think for one second
that the Capitol will ever treat us fairly

598
00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:41.243
you are lying to yourselves.

599
00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:44.929
Because we know who they are
and what they do.

600
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.244
This is what they do!
And we must fight back.

601
00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:56.887
I have a message for President Snow.

602
00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:00.171
You can torture us and bomb us

603
00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:02.527
and burn our districts to the ground.

604
00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:05.604
But do you see that?

605
00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:08.530
Fire is catching.

606
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:13.771
And if we burn, you burn with us!

607
00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:37.525
<i>We know who they are and what they do.</i>

608
00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:40.285
<i>This is what they do!</i>

609
00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:42.124
<i>And we must fight back.</i>

610
00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:47.127
<i>You can torture us and bomb us</i>

611
00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:49.767
<i>and burn our districts to the ground.</i>

612
00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:51.888
Plutarch's faith in you wasn't misplaced.

613
00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:53.041
<i>But do you see that?</i>

614
00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:54.287
Thank you.

615
00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:55.681
<i>Fire is catching.</i>

616
00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.285
Come up with me for the beginning.

617
00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:00.962
<i>And if we burn, you burn with us!</i>

618
00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:32.363
There is no progress without compromise.

619
00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:36.131
No victory without sacrifice.

620
00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:40.210
But I stand here with The Mockingjay

621
00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:44.042
to announce that our moment has arrived.

622
00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:13.841
Beetee has increased
our use of the airwaves tenfold.

623
00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:19.170
We will broadcast this message
to all the districts tonight.

624
00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:25.003
The Mockingjay's words inspiring everyone
to join the rebellion.

625
00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:28.807
Together, we will become

626
00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:30.843
an alliance to be reckoned with.

627
00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:37.409
Hoorah! Hoorah! Hoorah!

628
00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:43.046
You don't like hearing
a fight song at a funeral?

629
00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:48.523
The more people on our side,
the closer we are to Peeta and Annie.

630
00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:53.046
Yeah.

631
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.162
<i>By order of President Snow</i>

632
00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:18.124
<i>daily production quotas
have been increased.</i>

633
00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:22.400
<i>All work shifts will be extended
by an extra two hours.</i>

634
00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:25.844
<i>Failure to meet these quotas
will not be tolerated.</i>

635
00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:29.202
<i>By order of President Snow</i>

636
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:32.250
<i>daily production quotas
have been increased.</i>

637
00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:20.969
If we burn, you burn with us!

638
00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:25.651
Yeah!

639
00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:29.045
Yeah!

640
00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:52.082
- I got good news.
- What?

641
00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:53.764
Coin agreed to let us hunt above ground.

642
00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:47.808
He's not even afraid of us.

643
00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:51.964
It's 'cause they've never been hunted before.

644
00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:56.050
It's almost not fair.

645
00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:10.131
They want us back.

646
00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:26.765
They asked us to head for Command.

647
00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:28.968
All right. I gotta drop these off.

648
00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:38.882
<i>She was arguably our favorite Tribute.</i>

649
00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:43.245
<i>And I think that's what
we all find most astonishing,</i>

650
00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:48.162
<i>is that this girl was adored in the Capitol.</i>

651
00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:50.690
<i>And I think for you, Peeta,</i>

652
00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:53.526
<i>it must be particularly painful.</i>

653
00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:56.767
<i>I wish I could give this rose to you, Katniss.</i>

654
00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:59.247
He's changed so much already.
What are they doing to him?

655
00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:03.769
<i>A sweet gesture for a girl
who has inspired such violence.</i>

656
01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:05.925
<i>You must love her very much
to be able to forgive her.</i>

657
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.081
He's shaking.

658
01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:08.366
<i>I don't think that I could.</i>

659
01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:11.763
<i>Unless, of course, Peeta,
you think that perhaps she's being</i>

660
01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:17.007
<i>forced into saying things
that she doesn't even understand.</i>

661
01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:21.606
<i>Yeah. That's exactly what I think.</i>

662
01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:22.960
Even his voice is different.

663
01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:25.691
<i>I think they're using her
to whip up the rebels.</i>

664
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.889
<i>I doubt she even knows what's happening.</i>

665
01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:29.845
<i>And what's really at stake.</i>

666
01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.805
<i>Now, Peeta, I doubt that the rebels
will ever let her see this-</i>

667
01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:36.041
<i>But if they do, what would you say to her?</i>

668
01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:39.683
<i>To Katniss Everdeen,
the once sweet Katniss Everdeen.</i>

669
01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:43.241
<i>I would tell her to think for herself.</i>

670
01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.170
<i>Yes.</i>

671
01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:49.725
<i>Don't be a fool, Katniss.</i>

672
01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:53.163
<i>I know you never wanted the rebellion.</i>

673
01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:55.084
<i>The things that you did in the Games</i>

674
01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:58.961
<i>were never intended to start all of this.</i>

675
01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.566
<i>The rebels have made you
into something that you're not.</i>

676
01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.608
<i>Something that could destroy all of us.</i>

677
01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:08.283
<i>So if you have any power or any say</i>

678
01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:11.121
<i>in what they do or how they use you,</i>

679
01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:16.282
<i>please, please, urge them to stop this war</i>

680
01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.045
<i>before it's too late.</i>

681
01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:19.726
<i>And ask yourself,</i>

682
01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:22.761
<i>can you trust
the people you're working with?</i>

683
01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:26.924
<i>Do you know what they really want?</i>

684
01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.081
We need to respond.

685
01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:34.371
<i>Thank you, Peeta Mellark, for these
revelations about the real Mockingjay.</i>

686
01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.925
Did you see what he looks like?

687
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.331
I saw a coward.

688
01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.204
You don't have any idea
what he's going through.

689
01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:42.568
I don't care.
I would never say what he just said.

690
01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:45.327
Not if they tortured me.
Not with a gun to my head.

691
01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:48.449
That is the same Peeta
that defended you at the whipping post.

692
01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:51.490
No, it's not.
Now he's only defending himself.

693
01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:55.563
Coin's called a meeting.
We need to respond.

694
01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:57.847
When did "we" become you and Coin?

695
01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:00.004
Everyone has a choice.

696
01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:02.321
How can he sit there in the Capitol
and defend the people

697
01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:04.801
who destroyed his home
and murdered his family?

698
01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.051
He doesn't know.

699
01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:11.926
How could he?
Nobody's seen what the Capitol did to 12.

700
01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:14.450
I have to show them.

701
01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:33.043
So I wanna start with you
in front of the Justice Building, okay?

702
01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:39.090
Bang. First shot.

703
01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.722
Katniss, tell us what happened here.

704
01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.203
We were all standin' right here

705
01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:06.611
watchin' the Games
when you fired that arrow.

706
01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.087
The screens just went dark.
Nobody had any idea what happened.

707
01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.760
Peacekeepers forced us
back into our homes.

708
01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:19.451
For maybe an hour,
the town was just dead quiet.

709
01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:25.411
Little past 9:00,
we heard their trucks pullin' out.

710
01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:30.566
All of them. Every single Peacekeeper.

711
01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:34.849
And I knew what that meant.

712
01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:40.531
Me and a couple of guys from the mines,

713
01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:44.321
we started pulling people from their houses
and tried to get 'em to the fence line

714
01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.402
but a lotta people were scared of the forest.

715
01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:49.209
So they headed up onto the road.

716
01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.404
Make a break for it that way.

717
01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.723
Stay with Gale.

718
01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:09.771
915 of us
made it to the fence.

719
01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:16.560
Then we watched
as bombers circled back towards the road.

720
01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.886
They firebombed them as they ran away.

721
01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:43.445
915 outta 10,000.

722
01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.964
I should've grabbed people.
I should've dragged 'em with me.

723
01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:56.765
Some of the kids I could've carried.

724
01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:59.366
You saved so many people, Gale.

725
01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:04.491
Without you, there would be no District 12.
Not even the memory of it.

726
01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:39.249
This is where you kissed me.

727
01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:42.089
I didn't think you remembered that.

728
01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:54.087
I'd have to be dead to forget that.

729
01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:58.211
Maybe not even then.

730
01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:14.564
I knew you'd do that.

731
01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:17.609
HOW? I didn't.

732
01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:20.244
'Cause I'm in pain.

733
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.082
That's the only way
that I can get your attention.

734
01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:34.164
Don't worry, Katniss. It'll pass.

735
01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.286
<i>Hey-</i>

736
01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.288
Yeah, that's a mockingjay.

737
01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:25.848
Well, now they'll never shut up.

738
01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:32.645
You want me to sing?

739
01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:48.966
<i>Are you, are you comm' to the tree?</i>

740
01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:52.086
<i>Where they strung up a man</i>

741
01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:54.687
<i>They say who murdered three</i>

742
01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:59.762
<i>Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be</i>

743
01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:05.247
<i>If we met at midnight in the hanging tree</i>

744
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.006
<i>Are you, are you comm' to the tree?</i>

745
01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:16.526
<i>Where a dead man called out
for his love to flee</i>

746
01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:21.841
<i>Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be</i>

747
01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:27.366
<i>If we met at midnight in the hanging tree</i>

748
01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:32.960
<i>Are you, are you comm' to the tree?</i>

749
01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:38.366
<i>Where I told you to run
so we'd both be free</i>

750
01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:43.682
<i>Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be</i>

751
01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:49.206
<i>If we met at midnight in the hanging tree</i>

752
01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:53.844
<i>Are you, are you comm' to the tree?</i>

753
01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:57.563
<i>Wear a necklace of hope
side by side with me</i>

754
01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:59.802
That line was originally "necklace of rope."

755
01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:01.882
I had it changed to "necklace of hope."

756
01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:04.562
Wow. You are a true wordsmith.

757
01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:07.767
Little on the nose, but, of course, so is war.

758
01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:09.649
Every district's seeing this?

759
01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.563
Yes. But not the Capitol.

760
01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:15.929
I designed this
signal defense system for them.

761
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.843
But I can't find my way through it.

762
01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:20.249
Guess I did my job too well.

763
01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:24.163
At the time, I was just thinking of
the science of it all.

764
01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:26.925
We'll get through it.

765
01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:32.687
<i>Are you, are you comm' to the tree?</i>

766
01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:37.289
<i>Where they strung up a man
they say who murdered three</i>

767
01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:41.969
<i>Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be</i>

768
01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:46.927
<i>If we met at midnight in the hanging tree</i>

769
01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:51.648
<i>Are you, are you comm' to the tree?</i>

770
01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:56.648
<i>Where a dead man called out
for his love to flee</i>

771
01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.289
<i>Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be</i>

772
01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:06.327
<i>If we met at midnight in the hanging tree</i>

773
01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:02.486
Moves and countermoves.

774
01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:28.649
Katniss, you're wanted in Command.

775
01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:41.722
<i>Tonight, we've received reports
of derailed trains,</i>

776
01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:44.243
<i>of granaries on fire,</i>

777
01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:49.522
<i>and of a savage attack
on the hydroelectric dam in District 5.</i>

778
01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:51.130
What have they done to you?

779
01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:56.606
<i>I'm begging for restraint and decency.</i>

780
01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:59.570
We interrupt your
regularly scheduled horse manure

781
01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:01.130
to bring you...

782
01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:05.967
Comm' to the tree?

783
01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:07.360
That's it. That's our footage.

784
01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:08.646
Beetee's in.

785
01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:10.888
<i>They say who murdered three</i>

786
01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.246
<i>Katniss?</i>

787
01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:13.845
He sees it. He sees our propo.

788
01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:16.811
<i>No stranger would it</i> be...

789
01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:18.687
<i>Katniss, are you there?</i>

790
01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:20.206
Peeta.

791
01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:22.369
<i>Katniss?</i>

792
01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:27.047
<i>Peeta, please continue.</i>

793
01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:31.484
<i>You were telling us
about these savage attacks.</i>

794
01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:33.521
Yeah.

795
01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:42.523
<i>The attack on the dam was a callous</i>

796
01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:46.889
<i>and inhuman act of destruction...</i>

797
01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:52.082
<i>Where a dead man called out
for his love to flee</i>

798
01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:55.561
<i>Think about it.</i>

799
01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:00.685
<i>How will this end? What will be left?</i>

800
01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:03.004
<i>No one can survive this.</i>

801
01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:05.811
<i>No one is safe now.</i>

802
01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:07.690
<i>Not here in the Capitol.</i>

803
01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.731
<i>Not in any of the districts.</i>

804
01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:17.846
<i>They're coming, Katniss.
They're gonna kill everyone.</i>

805
01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:19.803
<i>And in District 13 you'll be dead by morning.</i>

806
01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.202
He's warning us. That was a warning.

807
01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:24.801
Yes, it was.

808
01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.291
We have to get him out before they kill him.

809
01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:28.727
- Is there anything in the air?
- Nothing on Doppler, ma'am.

810
01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:30.604
He was in the mansion.
He could have overheard something.

811
01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.041
Possibly.

812
01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:38.004
It's time for an air raid drill.

813
01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:48.569
<i>This is a code red alert.</i>

814
01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:52.486
<i>Please, remain calm
and begin evacuation protocol.</i>

815
01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:56.763
Prim! Prim!

816
01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:59.923
<i>Proceed to your nearest stairwell
and descend to level 40.</i>

817
01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:03.330
<i>Blast doors will be sealed in six minutes.</i>

818
01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.482
<i>This is a code red alert.</i>

819
01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:11.281
<i>Please, remain calm
and begin evacuation protocol.</i>

820
01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:14.689
<i>Proceed in an orderly fashion
to your nearest stairwell</i>

821
01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.922
<i>and descend to level 40.</i>

822
01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:21.404
Madam President, three Capitol squadrons
just entered our airspace.

823
01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:23.451
How much time do we have?

824
01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:25.204
They're a few seconds from range.

825
01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:31.885
Prepare to scramble the fleet.

826
01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.007
Copy that.

827
01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:36.209
Open up short-range air defense.

828
01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:42.609
Arm long-range missiles for counterattack.

829
01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:45.411
<i>Blast doors will be sealed in five minutes.</i>

830
01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:54.963
<i>This is a code red alert.</i>

831
01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:58.761
<i>Please, remain calm
and begin evacuation protocol.</i>

832
01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:02.249
<i>Proceed in an orderly fashion
to your nearest stairwell</i>

833
01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:04.209
<i>and descend to level 40.</i>

834
01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:07.290
<i>Blast doors will close in four minutes.</i>

835
01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:12.602
<i>This is a code red alert.</i>

836
01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:16.401
<i>Please, remain calm
and begin evacuation protocol.</i>

837
01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:19.848
<i>Proceed in an orderly fashion
to your nearest stairwell</i>

838
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.923
<i>and descend to level 40.</i>

839
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.163
<i>Blast doors will close in three minutes.</i>

840
01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:32.088
<i>This is a code red alert.</i>

841
01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:35.289
<i>Proceed in an orderly fashion
to your nearest stairwell</i>

842
01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:37.448
<i>and descend to level 40.</i>

843
01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:49.523
<i>Continue to the Supply Station
and claim one pack</i>

844
01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.807
<i>for each member of your compartment.</i>

845
01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:56.251
<i>Please keep all personal items
within your assigned area.</i>

846
01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:59.206
<i>Be courteous to your fellow citizens.</i>

847
01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.408
<i>This is a code red alert.</i>

848
01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:06.490
<i>All citizens should be inside the bunker.</i>

849
01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:10.044
<i>- Blast doors will close in two minutes.
- Mom</i> !

850
01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:14.121
Where's Prim?

851
01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:15.929
I thought she went to find you.

852
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.286
She must still be on the stairs.

853
01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:18.890
There's no one on the stairs.

854
01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:23.051
She went back for the cat.

855
01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:26.168
<i>This is a code red alert.</i>

856
01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:28.601
<i>All citizens should be inside the bunker.</i>

857
01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:29.647
Hey, stop! Stop!

858
01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:32.849
<i>Blast doors will close in one minute.</i>

859
01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:42.324
They hit the far edge of
the northwest quadrant. Penetrated 40 feet.

860
01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:45.688
Missed the living quarters.
Only minor damage to corridors 2 and 3.

861
01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:47.000
Is there any radiation?

862
01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:48.047
None detected.

863
01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:49.963
Doppler shows a fourth wave approaching.

864
01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:55.125
<i>- Blast doors will close in 30 seconds.</i>
- Prim!

865
01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:58.601
Prim!

866
01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:00.091
Katniss!

867
01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:07.530
<i>This is a code red alert.</i>

868
01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:08.681
Katniss!

869
01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:11.286
<i>Blast doors will close in 15 seconds.</i>

870
01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:12.691
Get down here!

871
01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:16.048
<i>- Hurry!
- This is a code red alert.</i>

872
01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:19.647
<i>Blast doors will close in 10 seconds.</i>

873
01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:21.361
Nine...

874
01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:23.521
<i>Eight...</i>

875
01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:25.761
Seven...

876
01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:28.281
Six...

877
01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:31.803
- Five...
- Hold the doors!

878
01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:33.406
Four...

879
01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:36.160
Three...

880
01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:39.289
- Two...
- Wait! Hold the doors!

881
01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.325
One.

882
01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:45.087
You went back for the cat?
What were you thinking?

883
01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:48.369
I wasn't gonna leave him behind.
I couldn't live with myself.

884
01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:51.368
<i>Blast doors are now sealed.</i>

885
01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:52.930
I know, Prim.

886
01:18:58.120 --> 01:18:59.326
Let's go.

887
01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:04.403
Damage to the aquifer
in the northwest quadrant.

888
01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:06.084
We lost a transport corridor.

889
01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:07.844
There's nothing else in the northwest.

890
01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:11.049
Our surface-to-air launchers
just took a direct hit in sector 3.

891
01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:15.246
Because we revealed ourselves.
They saw us firing there.

892
01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:20.329
Stand down. Don't launch the fleet.

893
01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:24.923
Another 12 Capitol bombers
approaching sector 3 in attack formation.

894
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.321
Hold fire on their approach.

895
01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:32.607
What'd they hit?

896
01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:34.921
Bedrock.
But there's debris in the ventilation shaft.

897
01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:36.451
They're not targeting our fleet.

898
01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:37.760
Or our Special Weaponry.

899
01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:39.763
They don't know what we have
or where we have it.

900
01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:42.328
Can you confirm
that everyone's safely in the bunker?

901
01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:43.526
Already done.

902
01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:47.045
Conceal all remaining anti-aircraft guns.

903
01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:49.726
Seal launching pads
and ventilation corridors.

904
01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:53.208
We are gonna wait this out.
This is what we're built for.

905
01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:55.482
They'll seal us in here like a tomb.

906
01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:57.689
The Capitol's working off
some outdated information.

907
01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:59.046
I'd rather not update it for them.

908
01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:01.568
Madam President, I know it's not my place...

909
01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:04.086
It's not. You're a welcome guest,
but you're out of your depth down here.

910
01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:07.811
Reduce oxygen to 14 % to conserve it.

911
01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:08.961
Copy that.

912
01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:13.407
Take a deep breath, Mr. Heavensbee.
It's gonna be a long night.

913
01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:54.886
Prim, talk about something. Anything.

914
01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:00.329
They promoted me at the hospital.

915
01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:03.045
I forgot to tell you.

916
01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:04.451
They're training me to be a doctor.

917
01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:08.444
They'd be stupid not to.

918
01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:24.161
<i>Hey-</i>

919
01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:26.521
Can I sit?

920
01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:27.761
Yeah.

921
01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:34.806
Snow's using Annie to punish you.

922
01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:37.248
He's taunting us with them.

923
01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:43.129
I didn't understand until just now
watching that stupid cat.

924
01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:53.647
After your first Games,

925
01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:57.647
I thought the whole romance was an act.

926
01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:02.723
We all expected you
to continue that strategy.

927
01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:08.051
But it wasn't until Peeta's heart stopped
and he nearly died that

928
01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:12.841
I knew I'd misjudged you.

929
01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:14.925
You love him.

930
01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:20.124
I'm not saying in what way.
Maybe you don't even know yourself.

931
01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:23.005
But anyone paying attention can see it.

932
01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:26.003
How do you live with it?

933
01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:32.165
I drag myself outta nightmares
and there's no relief in waking up.

934
01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:36.965
But it's better not to give in to it.

935
01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:41.287
Takes 10 times longer
to put yourself back together

936
01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:43.323
than it does to fall apart.

937
01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:56.643
Katniss? Katniss?

938
01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:58.811
Come with me.

939
01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:06.920
We took their best shot. Didn't we?

940
01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:09.520
Yeah.

941
01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:11.645
Your mother and sister okay?

942
01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:13.246
Yeah, they're fine.

943
01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:15.687
I need you to do something for us.

944
01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:19.881
I need you to tell Panem
that we survived an attack by the Capitol

945
01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:21.889
with no casualties.

946
01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:24.526
And we remain fully operational.

947
01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:26.566
Okay.

948
01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:28.810
You should know something.

949
01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:34.208
We had eight extra minutes of civilian
evacuation because of Peeta's warning.

950
01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:36.884
I won't forget that.

951
01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:39.406
Thank you.

952
01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:59.721
So Katniss,
it's "13 is alive and well and so am I."

953
01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:02.407
Katniss?

954
01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:05.647
Katniss.

955
01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:09.924
Never one to waste it in rehearsal, I know.

956
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.843
Why would they drop these?

957
01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:21.571
For me.

958
01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:23.609
Ready to go, Katniss?

959
01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:27.168
We're gonna do this, just like District 8.

960
01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:32.209
Tell me about the roses.

961
01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:42.088
Tell Snow 13 is alive and well.

962
01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:47.765
He's gonna kill Peeta.

963
01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:50.411
Let's try again. Can you speak up?
We don't have a mic on you.

964
01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:54.441
"13 is alive and well and so am I."

965
01:26:57.840 --> 01:26:59.683
He's gonna kill Peeta.

966
01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:03.721
I can't.

967
01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:04.921
Katniss?

968
01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:08.011
You can do it, Katniss.

969
01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:09.281
I can't do this.

970
01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:12.523
"13 is alive and well and so am I."

971
01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:15.730
He's just gonna keep...
He's never gonna stop.

972
01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:17.086
Cressida, we should cut the cameras.

973
01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:18.321
-...as long as I'm The Mockingjay.
- It's okay, Katniss.

974
01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:21.847
No. He warned me. He warned me about this.

975
01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:25.447
He's doing this because I'm The Mockingjay.

976
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.128
He's punishing Peeta to punish me.

977
01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:29.686
No.

978
01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:32.606
No, I can't do this.

979
01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:33.881
Katniss.

980
01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:36.167
Don't make me do this!

981
01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:37.287
Let her go.

982
01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:40.683
I gotta get out of here.

983
01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:02.161
So this is the end?

984
01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:05.531
I s'pose you're just gonna
hide down here forever?

985
01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:08.767
I can't be The Mockingjay.

986
01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:12.363
Not The Mockingjay. Just Katniss.

987
01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:19.488
You know, you're the only real friend
I have down here.

988
01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:28.648
I don't suppose they gave you
any kind of medication?

989
01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:29.801
You're unbelievable.

990
01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:31.882
Okay, but I meant what I said.

991
01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:36.402
Look, the reason I'm here is to let you know

992
01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:38.605
they're rescuing Peeta.

993
01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:41.327
What?

994
01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:45.041
The dam went down in District 5,
took out most of the power to the Capitol.

995
01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:47.088
Knocked out their signal defense.

996
01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:51.285
Beetee's inside their system now,
wreaking all kinds of havoc.

997
01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:54.486
A window is open to us.
How much longer? I don't know.

998
01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:57.211
I guess until the Capitol
can get the power back on.

999
01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:58.520
And President Coin?

1000
01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:01.683
You know, I can never
fully support that woman

1001
01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:06.766
in light of the prohibition
they have going on around this place,

1002
01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:09.526
but Plutarch got word

1003
01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:12.251
that Peeta and the others
are in the Tribute Center.

1004
01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:15.609
And with the power out,
Coin sees this as an opportunity.

1005
01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:19.805
She knows that Peeta is the Capitol's
weapon. The same way you're ours.

1006
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.482
And as opposed to having you two
pointing at each other,

1007
01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:25.610
she's going to get him.

1008
01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:27.441
I have to go help.

1009
01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:29.568
Hey, whoa, kiddo. Wait.

1010
01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:33.208
Come on. Are you just gonna jump
outta the vent and go storm the Capitol?

1011
01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:35.362
Besides, it's already underway.

1012
01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:39.329
Six soldiers went in. Volunteer only.

1013
01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:42.962
And guess who was
the first brave soul to sign up.

1014
01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:45.051
Gale.

1015
01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:56.489
- Okay, Finnick?
- Yeah.

1016
01:29:56.880 --> 01:30:00.726
Go in the center there. Those rocks.

1017
01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:06.402
Castor, to left.

1018
01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:08.210
Pollux, you're with me.

1019
01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:10.529
So we'll go straight to camera.

1020
01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:13.286
Okay? Finnick?

1021
01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:14.441
Yeah.

1022
01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:16.046
Okay.

1023
01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:20.849
Take your time. Just remember
to keep talking and don't stop.

1024
01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:26.528
This is Finnick Odair.

1025
01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:30.365
<i>Winner of the 65th Hunger Games.</i>

1026
01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:34.042
<i>And I'm coming to you from District 13,
alive and well.</i>

1027
01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:37.205
<i>We've survived an assault from the Capitol.</i>

1028
01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:40.286
<i>But I'm not here to give you recent news.</i>

1029
01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:42.363
Why is Finnick doing a propo?

1030
01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:44.205
It's a lot more than that.

1031
01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:46.203
Beetee's commandeered the system.

1032
01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:48.169
Now that they're down to generator power

1033
01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:50.322
there's a more limited range of frequencies
available to them.

1034
01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:52.289
And I'm filling them all up with Finnick.

1035
01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:55.284
Not many will see it, but whoever does
will think it's another propo.

1036
01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:58.842
What they don't know is this broadcast
is jamming their entire system with noise.

1037
01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:01.685
Early defense warning,
internal communications, everything.

1038
01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:03.725
As long as the broadcast goes through,

1039
01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:06.201
our team should be able
to get in and out undetected.

1040
01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:09.449
<i>The truth.
Not the myths about a life of luxury.</i>

1041
01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:12.649
<i>Not the lie about glory for your homeland.</i>

1042
01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:14.922
<i>You can survive the arena.</i>

1043
01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:17.561
<i>The moment you leave, you're a slave.</i>

1044
01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:35.169
<i>Mockingjay One, you are one minute out
from perimeter defense.</i>

1045
01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:36.401
Going dark.

1046
01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:38.050
<i>Stay low in case they're online.</i>

1047
01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:42.400
<i>President Snow used to sell me.</i>

1048
01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:45.723
<i>Or my body, at least. I wasn't the only one.</i>

1049
01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:48.201
<i>If a Victor is considered desirable,</i>

1050
01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:51.489
<i>the President gives them as a reward
or allows people to buy them.</i>

1051
01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:54.604
<i>If you refuse, he kills someone you love.</i>

1052
01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:57.969
Mockingjay One, you are 20 seconds
from perimeter defense.

1053
01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:04.921
Ten seconds.

1054
01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:06.889
Nine... Eight...

1055
01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:10.164
Seven... Six... Five...

1056
01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:13.650
Four... Three... Two...

1057
01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:15.646
One.

1058
01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:27.282
<i>No response from perimeter defense.
We're inside Capitol airspace.</i>

1059
01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:28.930
<i>To make themselves feel better,</i>

1060
01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.287
<i>my patrons would make presents
of money or jewelry.</i>

1061
01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:36.488
<i>But I found a much more valuable
form of payment.</i>

1062
01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:37.807
<i>Secrets.</i>

1063
01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:39.166
Gear up.

1064
01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:01.166
Switching to Night View.

1065
01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:11.211
There.

1066
01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:16.731
Command, we have visual
on the Tribute Center.

1067
01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:18.768
<i>Initiating final approach.</i>

1068
01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:24.686
Masks on.

1069
01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:33.522
<i>See, I know all the depravity,
the deceit and the cruelty</i>

1070
01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:36.001
<i>of the Capitol's pampered elite.</i>

1071
01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:41.210
<i>But the biggest secrets are about
our good President, Coriolanus Snow.</i>

1072
01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:50.360
Open the door.

1073
01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:01.491
<i>Command, this is Team Leader.</i>

1074
01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:04.689
<i>Prepare to deploy gas.
We will confirm once inside.</i>

1075
01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:11.808
<i>Such a young man when he rose to power.
Such a clever one to keep it.</i>

1076
01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:15.248
<i>How, you may ask, did he do it?</i>

1077
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.206
<i>One word.</i>

1078
01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:20.526
<i>Poison.</i>

1079
01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:28.246
Get ready to drop.

1080
01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.606
<i>He stopped every mutiny
before it even started.</i>

1081
01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:10.801
Clear.

1082
01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:18.844
Clear. Command, we're inside.
Heading toward target number one.

1083
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.731
Cell P45 lower level 2C.

1084
01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:23.847
Gas.

1085
01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:27.642
<i>There are so many mysterious deaths
to adversaries.</i>

1086
01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:31.322
<i>Even to allies who were threats.</i>

1087
01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:45.571
<i>Snow would drink from the same cup,
to deflect suspicion.</i>

1088
01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:48.610
<i>But antidotes don't always work,</i>

1089
01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:51.644
<i>which is why he wears roses
that reek of perfume.</i>

1090
01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.608
<i>Help cover the scent of blood from sores
in his mouth that will never heal.</i>

1091
01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:22.561
Gale.

1092
01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:29.371
<i>But he can't hide the scent
of who he really is.</i>

1093
01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:31.204
<i>He kills without mercy.</i>

1094
01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:34.091
<i>He rules with deception and fear.</i>

1095
01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:03.207
<i>His weapon of choice is the only thing
suited to such a man.</i>

1096
01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:06.648
<i>Poison. The perfect weapon for a snake.</i>

1097
01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:10.491
<i>What is this place?</i>

1098
01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:22.765
- Beetee?
- I'm losing them.

1099
01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:24.286
Powering back up.

1100
01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:30.161
Ma'am, the Capitol air defense system
is rebooting. It's coming back online.

1101
01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:32.009
Must be diverting power
from another source.

1102
01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:34.765
And filtering transmissions.
Another 60 seconds and we'll be cutoff.

1103
01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:37.081
Madam President,
should we call back the hovercraft?

1104
01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:40.285
Broadcast me.

1105
01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:44.008
If Snow's watching this,
maybe he'll let the signal in, if he sees me.

1106
01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:46.644
Put me on the air so he can see me.

1107
01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:47.881
Yes. Yes.

1108
01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:49.287
Put her on.

1109
01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:51.602
Can we do this? Can we still get in?

1110
01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:54.406
Yes. For the moment.
The line's open. He will only see you.

1111
01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:56.045
Okay, Katniss, go.

1112
01:37:56.480 --> 01:37:59.370
President Snow?
President Snow. It's Katniss.

1113
01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:02.131
There's no guarantee he's even watching.

1114
01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:03.930
I know, but he might be.

1115
01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.163
President Snow, I need to speak with you.
Are you there?

1116
01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:12.366
President Snow, it's Katniss.
Can you hear me?

1117
01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:15.205
I need to speak with you.

1118
01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:19.402
President Snow, it's Katniss.

1119
01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:22.643
President Snow, are you there?

1120
01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:27.325
Can you hear me?

1121
01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:34.041
President Snow...

1122
01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:36.811
<i>Miss Everdeen. What an honor.</i>

1123
01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:42.650
<i>I don't imagine you're calling
to thank me for the roses.</i>

1124
01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:46.131
I never asked for this.

1125
01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:49.449
I never asked to be in the Games.

1126
01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:52.769
- Boggs? Come in. Boggs?
- I never asked to be The Mockingjay.

1127
01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:58.001
Just wanted to save my sister.
And keep Peeta alive.

1128
01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:00.682
Come in. Boggs?

1129
01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:05.161
Please, just let him go.
And I will stop being The Mockingjay.

1130
01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:07.766
I will disappear.
You will never have to see me ever again.

1131
01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:09.285
<i>Miss Everdeen.</i>

1132
01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:12.211
<i>- Boggs, come in.
- You couldn't run from this...</i>

1133
01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:13.327
<i>COPY-</i>

1134
01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:15.846
<i>...any more than you could have run
from the Games.</i>

1135
01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:18.842
Command, I need a situation report.

1136
01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:21.440
<i>Boggs, we're running out of time. Hurry.</i>

1137
01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:24.241
Let's move.

1138
01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:25.486
<i>Please.</i>

1139
01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:27.210
You've won.

1140
01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:32.045
<i>You've already beaten me.</i>

1141
01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:38.205
Release Peeta. And take me instead.

1142
01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:45.645
<i>We're long past the opportunity
for noble sacrifice.</i>

1143
01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:47.444
Then tell me what to do.

1144
01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:49.648
<i>I've always kept my promises, haven't I?</i>

1145
01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:52.246
<i>You said you didn't want a war.</i>

1146
01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:54.689
<i>And that's just what's happened.</i>

1147
01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:59.243
<i>I told you what a fragile thing peace was.</i>

1148
01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:03.928
<i>And still, like a child,
you took pleasure in breaking it.</i>

1149
01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:07.249
<i>I know what you are.</i>

1150
01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:11.002
<i>I know you can't see past
your narrowest concerns.</i>

1151
01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:13.242
<i>But please, Miss Everdeen.</i>

1152
01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:16.966
<i>I doubt you know what honesty is anymore.</i>

1153
01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:18.730
Command, we're at the first target.

1154
01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:21.889
Preparing to extract Peeta.
Will confirm when he's in hand.

1155
01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:27.041
Mockingjay One,
prepare hovercraft for evac.

1156
01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:30.044
You asked me to convince you
that I was in love with Peeta.

1157
01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:32.089
Haven't I at least done that?

1158
01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:34.730
<i>Miss Everdeen,</i>

1159
01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:39.610
<i>it's the things we love most</i>

1160
01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:42.130
<i>that destroy us.</i>

1161
01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:48.051
<i>I want you to remember that I said that.</i>

1162
01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:56.809
<i>Don't you think I know your friends
are in the Tribute Center?</i>

1163
01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:00.721
<i>Cut them off</i>

1164
01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:03.804
- What happened?
- Boggs, come in.

1165
01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:04.927
What happened?

1166
01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.650
Boggs, come in. Do you read me?

1167
01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:10.051
- He knows that they're in there. It's a trap.
- Katniss, hold it.

1168
01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:13.171
We have to get a hold of them.
We have to tell them to get out. He knows.

1169
01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:15.242
There's no signal. We can't contact them.

1170
01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:19.127
No. Haymitch, he knew the whole time.
He was taunting me.

1171
01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:21.726
- No, Haymitch. They're in there.
- No, we don't know that.

1172
01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:27.643
Did I lose them both tonight?

1173
01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:33.326
Did I lose them? I lost them both. No! No!

1174
01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:43.521
There's no news.

1175
01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:47.205
I'm sorry.

1176
01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:52.527
It's the worst torture in the world.

1177
01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:57.770
Waiting, when you know
there's nothing you can do.

1178
01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:05.647
Especially for people like us.

1179
01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:11.088
But whatever strength, courage,

1180
01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:13.245
madness,

1181
01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:17.807
keeps us going,
you find it, at times like these.

1182
01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:22.689
You have it, soldier.

1183
01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:26.085
It's what's kept you alive all this time.

1184
01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:29.289
And it won't fail you now.

1185
01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:52.841
They're back.

1186
01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:03.005
I don't want that.

1187
01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:08.721
Johanna.

1188
01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:10.321
Finnick!

1189
01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:13.246
Finnick!

1190
01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:16.005
Annie? Annie!

1191
01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:22.281
You're safe. You're safe.

1192
01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:30.720
Gale!

1193
01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:35.246
Are you okay?

1194
01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:38.126
What? What is it?

1195
01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:39.281
I don't get it.

1196
01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:43.526
Every gun was back online and on us
and we flew right past them.

1197
01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:45.531
They let us go.

1198
01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:52.281
He's in there.

1199
01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:57.803
Gas we used on the guards knocked
him out, too, but it's wearing off now.

1200
01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:02.089
You should be there when he wakes up.

1201
01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:08.645
Thank you.

1202
01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:13.126
Thank you.

1203
01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:34.651
Peeta.

1204
01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:09.806
Peeta!

1205
01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:13.643
Peeta! Get off! Get off of her!

1206
01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:15.241
Let go!

1207
01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:52.602
No, Katniss. No, you're swollen.
Don't touch.

1208
01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:56.203
No, no, no. Calm down. You're okay.

1209
01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:00.531
Tell her she's awake.

1210
01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:06.248
Don't try to talk. Peeta's okay. I promise.

1211
01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:08.965
I just had to get him off you.

1212
01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:17.962
It's called hijacking.

1213
01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:22.204
We don't know how long
the Capitol's been doing this to Peeta.

1214
01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:26.727
It's fear conditioning.
Enhanced with Trackerjacker venom.

1215
01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:29.528
You were stung your first Games.
Remember?

1216
01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:33.649
The venom puts the subject
in a dissociative state.

1217
01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:36.522
And they torture him.

1218
01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:41.607
With shocks and beatings,
and strip down his identity.

1219
01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:44.570
And then all of that suffering and fear
is redirected.

1220
01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:48.281
Associated with other memories
or a person.

1221
01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:51.364
They can change his memories of Katniss?

1222
01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:53.200
To make her seem life-threatening.

1223
01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:57.002
They turned him into a weapon, Katniss.

1224
01:46:58.080 --> 01:46:59.411
To kill you.

1225
01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:01.881
But you can reverse it?

1226
01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:03.969
The fear is the most difficult thing
to overcome.

1227
01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:06.691
We're hardwired to remember fear best.

1228
01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:08.245
It's new terrain.

1229
01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:11.808
But we've put together a team.

1230
01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:14.768
I'm optimistic.

1231
01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:42.640
Good evening.

1232
01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:48.881
Yesterday, I authorized a covert
rescue mission inside the Capitol.

1233
01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:51.880
I am pleased to announce

1234
01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:55.044
that the Victors have been liberated!

1235
01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:05.571
<i>Let this day mark an historic change.</i>

1236
01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:09.968
<i>With The Mockingjay
and the Victors beside us,</i>

1237
01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:13.442
<i>we have sent a clear message to the Capitol.</i>

1238
01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:17.327
That we will never again endure injustice.

1239
01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:27.922
Today, a day on which we reunited family,

1240
01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:30.891
friends, and loved ones.

1241
01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:35.441
<i>Let all of Panem come together.</i>

1242
01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:40.400
<i>Not to battle
for the amusement of the Capitol.</i>

1243
01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:43.484
<i>But to join hands in this fight.</i>

1244
01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:53.046
Let today be the day we promise

1245
01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:56.886
never to give up, never to give in

1246
01:48:56.960 --> 01:48:59.930
until we have made a new Panem,

1247
01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:03.800
where leaders are elected,
not imposed upon us.

1248
01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:08.883
And where the districts are free
to share the fruits of their labors

1249
01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:11.281
and not fight one another for scraps!

1250
01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:26.489
This new Panem is on the horizon.

1251
01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:29.042
But we must take it for ourselves.

1252
01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:34.449
<i>The road there
leads through the sharp mountains</i>

1253
01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:37.649
<i>and deep ravines of District 2.</i>

1254
01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:42.487
<i>There in the heart of Panem's
steepest mountain range lies</i>

1255
01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:45.769
the Capitol's principal military facility.

1256
01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:49.161
<i>We can conquer this stronghold</i>

1257
01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:52.684
because we are one people,

1258
01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:56.527
one army, one voice.

1259
01:49:56.680 --> 01:50:01.163
<i>Because today is our new beginning.</i>

1260
01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:05.490
Today we have freed the Victors.

1261
01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:09.083
Tomorrow, Panem!

1262
01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:21.524
Hoorah! Hoorah! Hoorah!
