<i>Tick, not to dash your hopes, but
I don't deal this kind of product.</i>

Some girl fighting her boyfriend.

<i>He's in the back, making a deal.</i>

305
00:24:47.305 --> 00:24:49.600
<i>Next time, let's meet
someplace private.</i>

306
00:24:49.642 --> 00:24:52.353
Cops have more to worry about
than the squid trade.

307
00:24:52.395 --> 00:24:56.941
Oh, yeah? Assume the position,
you miserable techno-perv puke.

308
00:24:56.983 --> 00:24:59.278
Beat it, fuckwad!

309
00:24:59.319 --> 00:25:02.573
<i>Max, I was with a client.
You think that's funny?</i>

310
00:25:02.614 --> 00:25:04.491
Prick.

311
00:25:04.533 --> 00:25:08.579
<i>See that preppy puke's face?
Pissed all over his topsiders!</i>

312
00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:11.415
OK, it was funny,
but it could cost me money.

313
00:25:11.457 --> 00:25:15.754
Come on, amigo. No one knows
how to work them like you do.

314
00:25:15.795 --> 00:25:19.467
<i>You could sell a rat's asshole
for a wedding ring.</i>

315
00:25:19.508 --> 00:25:21.010
I could.

316
00:25:21.052 --> 00:25:25.056
- Let me buy you a drink. Bobby!
- Bobby!

317
00:25:25.097 --> 00:25:26.766
Bobby!

318
00:25:26.807 --> 00:25:30.978
Tequila, por favor. Double shots.
Make it a Tres Generaciones.

319
00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.105
Nothing but the best for Lenny,

320
00:25:33.147 --> 00:25:36.150
the finest cop to ever get
thrown off the vice squad.

321
00:25:36.192 --> 00:25:38.612
Fuck you.

322
00:25:39.655 --> 00:25:42.617
Yeah. Nice tie.

323
00:25:42.658 --> 00:25:46.204
- Thanks, Max.
- You dress like a fucking pimp.

324
00:25:46.245 --> 00:25:49.582
<i>- It cost more than your wardrobe.
- That's not saying much.</i>

325
00:25:49.624 --> 00:25:52.752
<i>It's the one thing that stands
between me and the jungle.</i>

326
00:25:52.794 --> 00:25:58.216
The jungle, where some bird can cap
you in the head and ruin your day.

327
00:25:58.257 --> 00:26:01.512
- You were lucky, Max.
- So darn lucky...

328
00:26:01.553 --> 00:26:07.644
<i>I wake up with a. 22 in my brain and
a cop pension I can't live off of.</i>

329
00:26:07.685 --> 00:26:10.814
<i>Damn! It's a good thing
I wasn't luckier.</i>

330
00:26:11.981 --> 00:26:13.942
Bobby, hit me again.

331
00:26:13.983 --> 00:26:16.736
<i>- You seen Faith lately?
- No, she won't call me.</i>

332
00:26:16.778 --> 00:26:18.655
<i>It's just as well.</i>

333
00:26:18.697 --> 00:26:23.828
Sure, Faith was the best woman you
could ever hope to get, and it's...

334
00:26:23.869 --> 00:26:27.916
<i>humiliating that she's gone,
but you got to face that it's over.</i>

335
00:26:27.958 --> 00:26:31.503
<i>Thanks, chaplain.
I'm touched by your concern.</i>

336
00:26:31.545 --> 00:26:34.214
I just hate to see you pining away.

337
00:26:34.256 --> 00:26:37.259
You're my friend.
It makes me want to vomit.

338
00:26:39.886 --> 00:26:43.516
- Hey, Iris. You OK?
- I got to talk to you.

339
00:26:43.558 --> 00:26:46.394
What happened?
Some john get rough on you?

340
00:26:46.436 --> 00:26:48.980
No. Can we talk in private? Please?

341
00:26:49.021 --> 00:26:52.108
<i>I'm in trouble. So is Faith.</i>

342
00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:55.821
<i>- There's the magic fucking word.
- Come with me to your car.</i>

343
00:26:55.863 --> 00:26:58.866
<i>- There's something you have to see.
- What's going on?</i>

344
00:26:58.907 --> 00:27:01.703
<i>It's a bad situation.</i>

345
00:27:01.745 --> 00:27:05.498
- What?
- If they get me, I know they'll...

346
00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.167
Who?

347
00:27:07.208 --> 00:27:09.711
Oh, shit.

348
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:16.634
<i>Hang on! That's my car!</i>

349
00:27:16.676 --> 00:27:19.513
Not any more. It belongs to the bank.

350
00:27:19.555 --> 00:27:21.640
Hey, wait a second.

351
00:27:21.682 --> 00:27:23.769
- Whoops.
- Oh, yeah.

352
00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:28.815
<i>Two million years of human evolution,
that's the best you can come up with.</i>

353
00:27:28.857 --> 00:27:31.818
What do you get to repo a car?
200? 250?

354
00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.362
I'll pay you 350 right now.

355
00:27:34.404 --> 00:27:37.532
- You got the cash?
- I was gonna write you a cheque.

356
00:27:37.574 --> 00:27:41.745
- See ya.
- I respect that. I would want cash.

357
00:27:41.787 --> 00:27:46.126
They'll take my cheque inside.
Just give me two minutes.

358
00:27:46.168 --> 00:27:49.129
Here. You can keep
my watch for collateral.

359
00:27:49.171 --> 00:27:52.299
<i>It's... It's a Rolex.</i>

360
00:27:52.341 --> 00:27:56.011
I'll be right back. Two minutes.
Two minutes?

361
00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:01.517
Son of a bitch!

362
00:28:13.864 --> 00:28:16.659
What happened to your car this time?

363
00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:21.664
See, Lenny, if you packed your piece,
you could make the guy see sense.

364
00:28:22.331 --> 00:28:24.459
Bobby, turn this up.

365
00:28:24.501 --> 00:28:29.214
# You watch us take it all

369
00:28:39.851 --> 00:28:42.895
# And you try to make me think
I did this to myself

370

- Everything's already been done.</i>

391
00:30:05.819 --> 00:30:10.616
<i>Every kind of music's been tried,

<i>I'm telling you, man, it's over.

<i>So, Max Peltier,
how's the PI business?</i>

400
00:30:38.397 --> 00:30:40.941
Sucks. But when I get
this new logo...

401
00:30:40.983 --> 00:30:43.193
I want to hear this scumbag.

402

<i>- 'Do you have any leads? '

available. He chose not to have it. '</i>

- You-know-who left Lenny for him.

00:30:55.206 --> 00:30:58.042
<i>- Faith left Lenny for him?
- Don't say Faith.</i>

406
00:30:58.084 --> 00:31:02.673
You use the "F" word around Lenny,
you got to tranquillise him.

407
00:31:02.715 --> 00:31:04.216

Everybody needs to walk to the dark
end of the street sometimes.

420
00:31:48.013 --> 00:31:51.768
The risks... The streets are
a war zone. Sex can kill you.

421
00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:53.687
Slip on the 'trodes,

get what you need almost as good as
the real thing and a lot safer.

423
00:31:58.192 --> 00:32:01.946
Porno. Face it, you sell porno
to wireheads.

424
00:32:01.987 --> 00:32:03.739
Harsh. Harsh and untrue.

425

My clients are professionals.
Some are even celebrities.

426

- What celebrities?
- The guy from the news.

427
00:32:10.204 --> 00:32:13.125
- He does the weather.
- That counts.

428

<i>- Hey, you passed La Cienega.

I'll give you 25%

<i>This may be hard for you, but friends

Look, I've pulled 12 hours.
I got to get some sleep.

436
00:32:39.611 --> 00:32:42.531
I got a pick-up at the St James Club.

437
00:32:42.573 --> 00:32:45.910
You can catch a cab. It'll take you
wherever you wanna go.

438
00:32:45.952 --> 00:32:49.497
A taxi? Well, someone might see me.

Hold it right there, ma'am.
Whoa. Hold it right there.

442
00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.845
Fumitsu. Fumitsu.

443
00:33:02.887 --> 00:33:05.264
Leave the car right here.

445
00:33:11.313 --> 00:33:13.440
- Nero.
- Strickland.

446
00:33:13.482 --> 00:33:14.942
Commissioner Strickland.

447
00:33:14.984 --> 00:33:19.655

know what disappoints me very much?</i>

451
00:33:32.335 --> 00:33:34.797
Your sex life? Excuse me.

452
00:33:34.838 --> 00:33:36.466
Mr Fumitsu.

453
00:33:38.093 --> 00:33:40.386
- Konbanwa.
- Konbanwa.

454
00:33:40.428 --> 00:33:43.431
Leonard Nero, BLS Limousine
and Security Service.

455
00:33:43.473 --> 00:33:47.644
I've arranged for one of our finest
drivers Lornette Mason to take you.

456
00:33:47.685 --> 00:33:51.022
<i>She's a security specialist,
trained in defensive combat,</i>

457
00:33:51.064 --> 00:33:54.025
<i>and the car's bulletproof
and fully armoured.</i>

458
00:33:54.067 --> 00:33:58.698
I'll be coming along to do our
routine periodic driver evaluation.

459
00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:02.244
We do it to ensure
that our VIP clients

460
00:34:02.285 --> 00:34:04.830
are always treated
as honoured guests.

461
00:34:04.871 --> 00:34:08.583
Good evening, Mr Fumitsu.
Sir, please watch your head.

462
00:34:12.212 --> 00:34:14.089
Excuse me, Mr Nero.

463
00:34:14.131 --> 00:34:16.049
Excuse me, sir!

464
00:34:16.091 --> 00:34:19.846
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Coming with you.

465
00:34:25.185 --> 00:34:28.439
You will not live
to see the morning.

466
00:34:30.649 --> 00:34:32.735
Drive on.

467
00:34:39.826 --> 00:34:43.079
Are you a cop?

468
00:34:43.121 --> 00:34:46.583
No? Good. Have you ever been wired?

469
00:34:46.624 --> 00:34:49.545
Wired?

470
00:34:49.879 --> 00:34:52.673
- The latest technology.
- Oh...

471
00:34:52.715 --> 00:34:54.467
That is beautiful.

472
00:34:54.508 --> 00:34:57.011
You got to take a look at this, OK?

473
00:34:57.052 --> 00:34:58.597
Yeah.

474
00:34:58.638 --> 00:35:01.808
- You're gonna love it.
- You have more?

475
00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:04.019
I have more. Believe me.

476
00:35:16.949 --> 00:35:20.412
<i>Hey! Hey! Careful on the jacket.
It's Armani.</i>

477
00:35:20.454 --> 00:35:23.665
- Hey, are you angry?
- No wirehead shit in my car!

478
00:35:23.707 --> 00:35:26.335
- You're on foot!
- In LA? Are you crazy?

479
00:35:32.716 --> 00:35:36.428
<i>Can I come in? I'm having a hard time
hearing the stereo!</i>

480
00:35:38.264 --> 00:35:40.976
<i>I need my case.
It's still in the back.</i>

481
00:35:48.025 --> 00:35:51.445
Can we talk here,
like two rational adults?

482
00:35:52.822 --> 00:35:54.240
Uhh!

483
00:35:55.116 --> 00:35:57.535
Um, that would be no.

484
00:35:58.744 --> 00:36:00.622
OK, you got my attention.

485
00:36:00.664 --> 00:36:04.377
This is cutting off the circulation
in my head. Do you mind?

486
00:36:04.419 --> 00:36:05.878
Macey...

487
00:36:15.346 --> 00:36:17.640
<i>It's cool, it's nothing. Two seconds.</i>

488
00:36:17.682 --> 00:36:21.562
This is uncharacteristic for you,
Miss Ice Water In Her Veins.

489
00:36:21.603 --> 00:36:25.649
You pushed me too far! You made me
lose it in front of a client!

490
00:36:25.691 --> 00:36:28.528
- I could get fired!
- Are we still friends?

491
00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:32.365
Friendship is more than one person
doing favours for another.

492
00:36:32.407 --> 00:36:35.076
<i>- I know.
- I don't hustle my friends.</i>

493
00:36:35.118 --> 00:36:39.122
You just suck people along with
your schemes and your slick act.

494
00:36:39.164 --> 00:36:42.168
<i>- We're still buddies?
- Don't use the time I'm talking</i>

495
00:36:42.209 --> 00:36:44.503
to think about what
you're gonna say next.

496
00:36:44.545 --> 00:36:46.422
- You listening?
- Yeah.

497
00:36:46.464 --> 00:36:49.550
You're always broke, you go
from one score to the next.

498
00:36:49.592 --> 00:36:52.888
<i>You're strung-out.
You don't even see it.</i>

499
00:36:52.929 --> 00:36:56.349
<i>It's your brain, so do whatever
the hell you want with it,</i>

500
00:36:56.391 --> 00:36:58.643
but not on my watch.

501
00:36:58.685 --> 00:37:01.146
I got a child, I got rent,

502
00:37:01.188 --> 00:37:05.359
<i>and I got an ex-husband doing hard
time who doesn't send me a dime.</i>

503
00:37:05.401 --> 00:37:07.904
<i>I'm just trying to hold on here.</i>

504
00:37:08.946 --> 00:37:12.992
<i>I know you wouldn't say this if
you didn't care about me. Thanks.</i>

505
00:37:13.034 --> 00:37:16.996
<i>You're getting out with Fumitsu,
and that's the end.</i>

506
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:22.294
I'll get you to the Templars
in ten minutes.

507
00:37:22.336 --> 00:37:25.632
<i>- Sorry for the inconvenience.
- I'm changing my plans.</i>

508
00:37:25.673 --> 00:37:30.804
Mr Nero has recommended an excellent
club, the Retinal Fetish.

509
00:37:30.845 --> 00:37:33.431
<i>- It's on La Cienega.
- Yes, sir.</i>

510
00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:46.947
- Enjoy your evening, Mr Fumitsu.
- Mace, I appreciate it. Thank you.

511
00:37:47.614 --> 00:37:49.783
Hey, come on.

512
00:37:49.825 --> 00:37:51.701
Excuse us.

513
00:37:52.536 --> 00:37:54.412
Excuse us.

514
00:37:55.747 --> 00:37:57.332
Excuse us.

515
00:37:57.374 --> 00:38:02.129
This is a friend of mine, Mr Fumitsu.
Can you take care of him?

516
00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:06.134
John, could you take care
of this gentleman?

517
00:38:07.301 --> 00:38:09.388
Hey. Bye.

518
00:39:11.121 --> 00:39:14.875
<i>- Hey, Lenny. How ya doing?
- Who's the new guy in Gant's posse?</i>

519
00:39:14.917 --> 00:39:19.087
Wade Beemer, played running back
for the Rams, '96, '97.

520
00:39:19.129 --> 00:39:21.298
Like a fucking freight train.

521
00:39:25.386 --> 00:39:28.265
- Rams... Football, right?
- No, ping-pong

522
00:39:28.307 --> 00:39:30.434
Hey, Iris was looking for you.

523
00:39:37.316 --> 00:39:38.984
Hello, Lenny.

524
00:39:39.026 --> 00:39:43.030
<i>It's OK, Wade, he's an old friend
of mine, Lenny Nero.</i>

525
00:39:44.073 --> 00:39:47.243
<i>Come to peddle me some clips
for old time's sake,</i>

526
00:39:47.284 --> 00:39:49.705
<i>or just makin' a few bucks
for the holidays?</i>

527
00:39:49.747 --> 00:39:53.501
<i>I wouldn't sell you
the sweat off a dead dog's balls.</i>

528
00:39:53.543 --> 00:39:56.796
I've already got everything
I need from you.

529
00:39:57.672 --> 00:39:59.757
Cut it out, Philo.

530
00:39:59.799 --> 00:40:02.135
Too bad about your guy Jeriko.

531
00:40:02.176 --> 00:40:04.303
You lost your golden goose.

532
00:40:04.345 --> 00:40:07.640
Show some respect.
He was an important artist.

533
00:40:07.682 --> 00:40:11.103
Important for your label,
which is why you're mourning.

534
00:40:11.145 --> 00:40:14.899
<i>His records will sell out
now he's dead, and you'll make out.</i>

535
00:40:14.941 --> 00:40:16.609
Always do.

536
00:40:16.651 --> 00:40:19.821
Faith, can I talk to you
for one second?

537
00:40:19.863 --> 00:40:22.657
<i>It's not a good idea right now.</i>

538
00:40:22.699 --> 00:40:24.826
Just for one second, OK?

539
00:40:24.868 --> 00:40:28.663
- About what?
- That would be between me and Faith.

540
00:40:31.083 --> 00:40:34.211
<i>Funny, I don't feel anything
between you and Faith.</i>

541
00:40:34.253 --> 00:40:35.838
You see...

542
00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:38.884
<i>that's your problem, Lenny,
you assume too much.</i>

543
00:40:38.925 --> 00:40:41.845
<i>You assume there's something
where there's nothing,</i>

544
00:40:41.887 --> 00:40:44.181
you assume that you have a life,

545
00:40:44.222 --> 00:40:48.435
<i>when in fact, you're just peddling
pieces of other people's lives</i>

546
00:40:48.477 --> 00:40:50.938
and the broken parts of your own.

547
00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:52.523
Faith...

548
00:40:52.565 --> 00:40:54.442
Get him to his car.

549
00:40:54.484 --> 00:40:57.361
Call me, OK? Faith!

550
00:40:57.403 --> 00:40:59.614
Call me!

551
00:40:59.655 --> 00:41:01.657
Lenny the loser.

552
00:41:01.699 --> 00:41:05.412
<i>- Leave him alone, Philo, OK?
- You shouldn't talk to him.</i>

553
00:41:05.454 --> 00:41:09.333
<i>You shouldn't talk to anybody,
not with everything that's going on.</i>

554
00:41:09.374 --> 00:41:13.087
You are too goddam paranoid.
You know that, Philo?

555
00:41:13.129 --> 00:41:15.590
<i>Paranoia's just...</i>

556
00:41:15.632 --> 00:41:18.218
reality on a finer scale.

557
00:41:21.596 --> 00:41:23.473
Thank you

558
00:41:58.262 --> 00:42:01.306
Awoo! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

559
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:12.109
<i>- Hey.
- Hey! What's up, my brother?</i>

560
00:42:13.277 --> 00:42:17.741
<i>- Those rascals haven't grown back?
- No. Any day now. I just know it.</i>

561
00:42:17.783 --> 00:42:19.869
Hey, I got something for you.

562
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:23.664
<i>It's a present,
something I had custom-made.</i>

563
00:42:23.706 --> 00:42:25.833
- Happy Millennium.
- Oh.

564
00:42:26.792 --> 00:42:30.588
I got something for you, too.
Just showed up tonight.

565
00:42:30.629 --> 00:42:33.591
<i>I don't know who from.</i>

566
00:42:33.632 --> 00:42:36.553
Fan mail from some flounder?

567
00:43:02.456 --> 00:43:03.707
Mmm.

568
00:43:07.837 --> 00:43:10.381
- Hi.
- Hi.

569
00:43:23.437 --> 00:43:26.774
# Strange days not like before #

570
00:43:56.764 --> 00:43:59.894
# I can hardly wait

571

# I can hardly wait

574

<i># It's been so long</i>

575
00:44:25.464 --> 00:44:29.092
# I've lost my taste

576
00:44:29.134 --> 00:44:31.553
# Say angel, come

577
00:44:31.595 --> 00:44:34.723
# Say lick my face

578
00:44:34.764 --> 00:44:37.726
# Let fall your drapes

579
00:44:37.767 --> 00:44:40.897
# I'll play the part

580
00:44:40.938 --> 00:44:44.650
# I open this mouth wide

581
00:44:44.692 --> 00:44:49.615
# Eat your heart... #

582
00:44:52.242 --> 00:44:56.705
# Your heart

# Make my watered brain #

595
00:46:00.065 --> 00:46:01.943
Hi, baby.

596
00:46:01.985 --> 00:46:03.904
I missed you.

597
00:46:03.946 --> 00:46:06.657
Lenny, you have to leave. I mean it.

598
00:46:06.699 --> 00:46:09.702
Iris said you were in trouble.
What did she mean?

599
00:46:09.743 --> 00:46:12.413
- You talked to Iris? When?
- Tonight.

600
00:46:12.454 --> 00:46:14.832
<i>I haven't seen that girl in months.</i>

601
00:46:14.874 --> 00:46:17.626
<i>Who knows what's going on
in that whore's head?</i>

602
00:46:17.668 --> 00:46:19.753
She used to be your best friend.

603
00:46:19.795 --> 00:46:24.718
<i>Iris? You're really running out of
excuses to come around, aren't you?</i>

604
00:46:24.759 --> 00:46:28.306
<i>I know you. You're afraid
of something. What's going on?</i>

605
00:46:28.347 --> 00:46:31.184
Let it alone.
It will take care of itself.

606
00:46:31.225 --> 00:46:33.686
<i>It's Gant, isn't it? He's poison.</i>

607
00:46:33.728 --> 00:46:37.273
<i>He's got you walled in
and he uses the wire too much.</i>

608
00:46:37.315 --> 00:46:39.692
He gets off on tape, not on you.

609
00:46:39.734 --> 00:46:42.570
<i>That's a good one coming from you.</i>

610
00:46:42.612 --> 00:46:45.824
<i>- Why don't you just split?
- Cos I don't want to.</i>

611
00:46:45.866 --> 00:46:48.702
<i>Do you love him? I don't think so.</i>

612
00:46:48.744 --> 00:46:52.707
To him, you're some kind of
possession. You're like a Ferrari.

613
00:46:52.749 --> 00:46:56.294
You're just something
to show the other guys.

614
00:46:56.336 --> 00:46:59.506
Yeah? He has his uses, too, you know.

615
00:46:59.547 --> 00:47:02.592
What? He going to record you
on his label?

616
00:47:02.634 --> 00:47:04.720
He might.

617
00:47:04.762 --> 00:47:06.847
You never know, right?

618
00:47:07.765 --> 00:47:09.850
Faith...

619
00:47:09.892 --> 00:47:14.355
Faith, listen to me. I've watched you
create yourself out of nothing.

620
00:47:14.396 --> 00:47:20.237
You're like a goddam cruise missile
targeted on making it, and you will.

621
00:47:20.278 --> 00:47:23.031
I know I will.

622
00:47:23.073 --> 00:47:25.535
<i>It's you up on that stage, not him.</i>

623
00:47:25.576 --> 00:47:27.662
<i>You don't need him.</i>

624
00:47:30.206 --> 00:47:33.960
Get out of here. If Philo
catches you, he'll hurt you.

625
00:47:34.001 --> 00:47:37.588
<i>- I'm already hurting.
- I'm serious. He's acting crazy.</i>

626
00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:41.592
<i>He's doing way too much playback.
He's gotten completely paranoid.</i>

627
00:47:41.634 --> 00:47:46.474
<i>He's such a control freak now, he's
even paying Max to follow me around.</i>

628
00:47:46.516 --> 00:47:50.145
- Max? You're kidding.
- Yeah, for about a month now.

629
00:47:50.937 --> 00:47:52.397
Jesus.

630
00:47:52.438 --> 00:47:58.403
Look, Lenny, just stay away
from Philo and stay away from me.

631
00:47:58.444 --> 00:48:01.197
Stop trying to rescue me.
Those days are over.

632
00:48:01.239 --> 00:48:03.199
<i>I'm a big girl now. I've changed.</i>

633
00:48:03.241 --> 00:48:07.789
<i>Stop trying to save me, I don't need
saving. Just give up on me!</i>

634
00:48:09.082 --> 00:48:12.627
I just... I just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

635
00:48:15.297 --> 00:48:19.551
You know one of the ways that movies
are still better than playback?

636
00:48:19.593 --> 00:48:22.512
<i>Cos the music comes up,
there's credits,</i>

637
00:48:22.554 --> 00:48:25.557
<i>and you always know when it's over.</i>

638
00:48:26.809 --> 00:48:28.895
<i>It's over!</i>

639
00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:33.066
You were great.

640
00:48:39.448 --> 00:48:42.284
Hey, man. I know what
you're thinking.

641
00:48:42.326 --> 00:48:47.039
- She told me about your new gig.
- Man, I feel like shit about it.

642
00:48:47.081 --> 00:48:50.877
- You should feel like shit.
- I do feel like shit. OK?

643
00:48:50.919 --> 00:48:54.881
- Hey, you introduced me to Gant.
- I introduced him to Faith, too.

644
00:48:54.923 --> 00:48:59.053
Qçuestionable move,
given the historical perspective.

645
00:48:59.094 --> 00:49:02.640
<i>I can take his money. You wouldn't
believe what I'm charging.</i>

646
00:49:02.681 --> 00:49:05.768
And I make sure Faith is OK
at the same time.

647
00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:08.271
Keep an eye on her, for you. OK?

648
00:49:08.313 --> 00:49:12.609
<i>Which you can't do without getting
your fingers bent the wrong way back.</i>

649
00:49:12.651 --> 00:49:15.737
<i>I'm busted, man. I need the money.</i>

650
00:49:15.779 --> 00:49:19.950
- This does us both some good.
- Fairly twisted logic, even for you.

651
00:49:19.991 --> 00:49:23.037
- Hey, you got a job.
- I got a job.

652
00:49:23.079 --> 00:49:25.164
<i>OK. I'm sorry. You got a job.</i>

653
00:49:25.206 --> 00:49:27.375
<i>- That's great.
- I got a job!</i>

654
00:49:27.416 --> 00:49:31.129
Hey, listen. You got to stay on her.
Watch her for me, please.

655
00:49:31.171 --> 00:49:34.466
<i>- I'm on her.
- OK.</i>

656
00:49:34.508 --> 00:49:37.010
- Take it easy, all right?
- Yeah. You, too.

657
00:49:41.265 --> 00:49:43.350
Come on.

658
00:49:45.477 --> 00:49:48.857
Here, chicky, chicky, chicky,
chicky, chicky...

659
00:49:48.898 --> 00:49:52.611
Hey, wait a minute. I recognise you.
You're Wade Beemer, right?

660
00:49:52.653 --> 00:49:56.073
Running back for the Rams. '96, '97.

661
00:49:56.115 --> 00:49:59.618
<i>- Am I right?
- Yeah. Th-That's right.</i>

662
00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:03.289
I saw you play, man.
I mean, you were good, really good.

663
00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:05.624
<i>Like a fuckin' freight train.</i>

664
00:50:05.666 --> 00:50:07.877
What happened? Injuries or what?

665
00:50:07.918 --> 00:50:10.797
<i>- Oh, bullshit politics.
- It's always politics.</i>

666
00:50:10.839 --> 00:50:13.342
<i>Like this thing.
He's paying you to tune me up.</i>

667
00:50:13.384 --> 00:50:15.511
I could pay you more not to.

668
00:50:15.553 --> 00:50:19.599
- I could write a cheque right now.
- Ah... I got to go.

669
00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:23.311
<i>OK. Cash... Cash!
Here's everything I have on me.</i>

670
00:50:23.352 --> 00:50:26.564
Oh, look. What do you say?
How about, uh, a Rolex?

671
00:50:27.648 --> 00:50:29.984
I got a real one.

672
00:50:30.026 --> 00:50:33.530
<i>Come on. It won't hurt too bad.
It's nothing personal.</i>

673
00:50:33.572 --> 00:50:36.116
Just one second, please.

674
00:50:38.745 --> 00:50:42.081
<i>It's my jacket. It's...
It's really expensive.</i>

675
00:50:42.123 --> 00:50:44.751
And just not... not the eyes.

676
00:50:57.973 --> 00:50:59.850
You're bleeding.

677
00:50:59.892 --> 00:51:03.522
Some jerk puked on the stairs,
and I slipped. I should sue.

678
00:51:03.563 --> 00:51:05.440
You came back for me.

679
00:51:05.482 --> 00:51:08.443
I came back to pick up my client.

680
00:51:08.485 --> 00:51:10.904
No, you came back for me.

681
00:51:10.946 --> 00:51:13.866
I got to lie down, Macey,
please, in the back?

682
00:51:33.847 --> 00:51:36.224
Some piece of work, Lenny Nero.

683
00:51:37.308 --> 00:51:40.645
You're calmly backstroking along
in the big toilet bowl,

684
00:51:40.687 --> 00:51:43.314
and somehow,
you never let it touch you.

685
00:51:43.356 --> 00:51:48.111
I mean, between working vice and your
current so-called occupation,

686
00:51:48.153 --> 00:51:50.530
you must have seen every perversion.

687
00:51:50.572 --> 00:51:53.952
But you just like some Teflon man.

688
00:51:53.994 --> 00:51:58.331
Still come out this...
goofball romantic.

689
00:51:58.373 --> 00:52:01.626
<i>It's my sword and my shield, Macey.</i>

690
00:52:12.804 --> 00:52:15.892
All right. A little B & E action.

691
00:52:15.933 --> 00:52:17.895
<i>- What'd you say?
- Oh, nothing.</i>

692
00:53:58.588 --> 00:54:00.464
Shit.

693
00:54:15.021 --> 00:54:16.981
No, no.

694
00:54:17.023 --> 00:54:19.109
Please. Please.

695
00:54:19.151 --> 00:54:20.527
Please...

696
00:54:20.569 --> 00:54:23.573
You can let me go, please.

697
00:54:23.615 --> 00:54:26.743
<i>I haven't seen your face. Please.</i>

698
00:54:26.784 --> 00:54:31.164
L- Let me go.
Let me go, please...

699
00:54:31.206 --> 00:54:33.458
Oh, my... Holy...

700
00:54:36.586 --> 00:54:39.088
Lenny...

701
00:54:39.715 --> 00:54:40.883
Lenny!

702
00:54:40.925 --> 00:54:43.886
Go to the Sunset Regent right now.

703
00:54:43.928 --> 00:54:46.263
Go! Go!

704
00:54:59.694 --> 00:55:01.572
Oh, Christ.

705
00:55:06.244 --> 00:55:09.038
<i>He's jacking it into his own output!</i>

706
00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:11.249
<i>She's seeing what he's seeing.</i>

707
00:55:11.290 --> 00:55:14.545
<i>She's... She's seeing herself!</i>

708
00:55:41.825 --> 00:55:43.493
Ohh...

709
00:55:48.248 --> 00:55:50.000
My God...

710
00:56:05.225 --> 00:56:07.436
God!

711
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:26.623
Oh, my God... Oh, my God...

712
00:57:13.006 --> 00:57:15.509
Lenny... What is it?

713
00:57:15.551 --> 00:57:18.805
- A black-jack.
- Black-jack?

714
00:57:18.847 --> 00:57:21.099
A snuff clip.

715
00:57:22.517 --> 00:57:24.269
It was Iris.

716
00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:28.023
<i>- The sick fucker killed her.
- Are you sure it's real?</i>

717
00:57:38.659 --> 00:57:43.415
Tell 'em we got a 187.
Call it in.

718
00:58:31.967 --> 00:58:34.054
Well, I lost my appetite...

719
00:58:34.095 --> 00:58:36.181
for about a year.

720
00:58:40.519 --> 00:58:44.314
<i>- Wanna take a look?
- Hell, no. I don't fool with that.</i>

721
00:58:47.275 --> 00:58:49.445
- You all right?
- Yeah.

722
00:58:49.487 --> 00:58:51.697
- You OK?
- No. Not really.

723
00:58:55.409 --> 00:58:58.247
<i>All right. Let's work it.</i>

724
00:58:58.288 --> 00:59:00.916
No, I... I can't.

725
00:59:00.958 --> 00:59:03.627
Come on, Lenny,
you used to be good at this shit.

726
00:59:03.669 --> 00:59:06.046
<i>Let's play it down.
What's the perp doing?</i>

727
00:59:06.088 --> 00:59:09.092
<i>- I can't.
- You used to be a fuckin' cop, OK?</i>

728
00:59:09.133 --> 00:59:11.761
Now, that is a fucking murder.

729
00:59:12.512 --> 00:59:15.765
<i>- What's he doing?
- OK. H-He stalks her.</i>

730
00:59:15.807 --> 00:59:18.685
And, uh...

731
00:59:18.726 --> 00:59:21.145
he rapes her... and he does her.

732
00:59:21.187 --> 00:59:24.525
And records it, right?
He wants to see it again and again.

733
00:59:24.567 --> 00:59:27.736
He records himself
raping and killing.

734
00:59:27.778 --> 00:59:30.907
- While sending a signal to her.
- So she feels what he feels

735
00:59:30.949 --> 00:59:33.034
<i>while he's inside her.</i>

736
00:59:33.076 --> 00:59:37.998
<i>The thrill while he's killing her
is sent to her, heightening her fear,</i>

737
00:59:38.039 --> 00:59:41.710
which, in turn,
heightens the turn-on for him.

738
00:59:43.295 --> 00:59:45.422
I've seen... I've seen a lot.

739
00:59:45.463 --> 00:59:47.884
<i>- So have I. Too much.
- It's a bad one.</i>

740
00:59:51.471 --> 00:59:55.434
He makes her see her own death,
feeds off the reaction.

741
00:59:55.475 --> 00:59:58.103
He records it all. Everything.

742
00:59:58.145 --> 01:00:01.982
- And gives it to you.
- Yeah. He wants to share it.

743
01:00:02.024 --> 01:00:05.235
<i>Of course he wants to share, man.
That's his deal.</i>

744
01:00:05.277 --> 01:00:08.113
He needs an audience.
This is a sick puppy.

745
01:00:08.155 --> 01:00:11.451
- Why me?
- Cos you're the magic man, Lenny.

746
01:00:11.492 --> 01:00:13.579
You make dreams happen.

747
01:00:13.621 --> 01:00:17.750
<i>If it's got something to do with
the wire, it washes up on your beach.</i>

748
01:00:17.791 --> 01:00:21.545
I've never dealt in black-jacks.
Never. Everybody knows that.

749
01:00:21.587 --> 01:00:25.841
<i>He's just skull-fucking you, buddy.
He just wants a reaction out of you.</i>

750
01:00:25.883 --> 01:00:29.386
He wants to make you do something
that you do not want to do.

751
01:00:29.428 --> 01:00:32.807
<i>Maybe he figures Lenny will
appreciate what he's created.</i>

752
01:00:32.849 --> 01:00:35.936
<i>It's the dark end of the street.
How do you like it now?</i>

753
01:00:35.977 --> 01:00:40.983
<i>- Jesus, Mace, back off.
- This guy's one of your squid-heads.</i>

754
01:00:41.025 --> 01:00:44.487
<i>- He's somebody you know, Lenny.
- The problem with that is</i>

755
01:00:44.529 --> 01:00:46.989
Lenny knows... everybody.

756
01:00:47.031 --> 01:00:49.951
- Take the tape to the cops.
- No.

757
01:00:50.993 --> 01:00:53.747
No. I'll... They'll crucify me.

758
01:00:53.789 --> 01:00:58.794
So this wire-freak
gets to keep running around, huh?

759
01:00:58.835 --> 01:01:00.963
<i>The police will think he's the perp.</i>

760
01:01:01.004 --> 01:01:04.133
They'll go through his client list,
and ruin his life...

761
01:01:04.801 --> 01:01:06.886
such as it is.

762
01:01:06.928 --> 01:01:10.056
I'll call my buddies at homicide,
say Iris was my friend.

763
01:01:10.098 --> 01:01:14.228
That'll put me in the loop. I'll get
the forensics and all that shit.

764
01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:19.233
Get some sleep. I'll call you
when I get something. Relax!

765
01:01:21.569 --> 01:01:23.612
Lenny!

766
01:01:23.654 --> 01:01:26.740
<i>Keep moving, man.
Somebody's thinking about you a lot.</i>

767
01:02:04.115 --> 01:02:05.867
Leave me alone!

768
01:02:07.410 --> 01:02:10.496
<i>Don't come to my house.
Are you trying to ruin my life?</i>

769
01:02:10.538 --> 01:02:13.458
Iris is dead. She was murdered.

770
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:20.550
<i>- Who did it?
- Whoever he is, he's damaged goods.</i>

771
01:02:20.592 --> 01:02:22.886
Iris said you were in danger, too.

772
01:02:22.928 --> 01:02:25.847
<i>- I'm not in any danger.
- Faith! No more games.</i>

773
01:02:25.889 --> 01:02:30.560
Whatever you're hiding you have
to get out of here. Come with me now!

774
01:02:30.602 --> 01:02:33.855
Then what? Are you gonna protect me?
Are you a tough guy?

775
01:02:33.897 --> 01:02:37.151
<i>You're a fucking talker.
You don't even own a gun.</i>

776
01:02:37.193 --> 01:02:39.403
I have a gun under my bed.

777
01:02:44.201 --> 01:02:47.287
<i>You don't know what you're
fucking with here.</i>

778
01:02:47.329 --> 01:02:50.624
- Tell me.
- Tell him, Faith. Go on.

779
01:02:52.125 --> 01:02:56.505
Uh, listen. Lenny just stopped by
to give me some bad news, OK?

780
01:02:56.547 --> 01:03:00.176
<i>An old friend of mine's
been murdered. Remember Iris?</i>

781
01:03:00.218 --> 01:03:02.345
How the fuck did you get up here?

782
01:03:02.387 --> 01:03:03.888
Charm.

783
01:03:05.098 --> 01:03:08.519
Tell you what, Lenny.
Just for you, hmm?

784
01:03:08.561 --> 01:03:11.647
<i>Make you a deal.
Why don't you just take her? Hm?</i>

785
01:03:11.689 --> 01:03:15.150
<i>If she's so unhappy and she wants
to leave, she can go!</i>

786
01:03:15.192 --> 01:03:19.614
<i>Besides, Faith always knows
what she wants. Don't you, baby?</i>

787
01:03:19.656 --> 01:03:22.367
See? Hands off.

788
01:03:24.703 --> 01:03:29.165
I'll tell you something else.
I'll tell you this, you fuck.

789
01:03:29.207 --> 01:03:32.210
If she says she stays, you go.

790
01:03:32.252 --> 01:03:35.298
You crawl back to wherever
the fuck it is you came from

791
01:03:35.339 --> 01:03:37.425
and never cross my vision again.

792
01:03:42.014 --> 01:03:43.473
Faith...

793
01:03:45.392 --> 01:03:47.269
Come on.

794
01:03:52.691 --> 01:03:54.776
Come on...

795
01:04:02.119 --> 01:04:04.371
I've made my choice, Lenny.

796
01:04:10.336 --> 01:04:12.421
Get him out.

797
01:04:13.214 --> 01:04:15.299
Get him out!

798
01:04:15.341 --> 01:04:19.345
You're fucking crazy, Faith!
You're fucking crazy! Come with me!

799
01:04:19.386 --> 01:04:21.348
Faith!

800
01:04:24.602 --> 01:04:28.064
<i>I don't love you any more.
Do you understand that?</i>

801
01:04:28.105 --> 01:04:33.569
You mean nothing to me!
Leave me alone, Lenny, please!

802
01:04:37.281 --> 01:04:41.203
You said you were gonna get Iris
out of this, Philo.

803
01:04:41.245 --> 01:04:43.538
Now you understand
the danger we're in.

804
01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:47.752
So sweet what you said out there,
so touching. I almost believed it.

805
01:04:47.794 --> 01:04:51.756
<i>I don't think he even understands
you did it for him.</i>

806
01:04:51.798 --> 01:04:54.509
<i>He doesn't know what's going on.
Leave him alone!</i>

807
01:04:54.551 --> 01:04:56.427
<i>I'd love to leave him alone</i>

808
01:04:56.469 --> 01:05:00.139
<i>if he'd stop coming round
and you'd stop talking!</i>

809
01:05:03.477 --> 01:05:06.730
<i>The only time a whore should open
her mouth is when she's giving head.</i>

810
01:05:14.489 --> 01:05:16.908
Shit! Mace! Help!

811
01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:20.203
<i>Don't be shy, Lenny.
This is your floor.</i>

812
01:05:20.245 --> 01:05:23.374
Come on now, Lenny.
You're going to the hospital.

813
01:05:23.416 --> 01:05:27.336
Can we be smart here?
I could make it worth your while.

814
01:05:27.378 --> 01:05:31.340
<i>I don't mind a couple of shots.
Just go light is all I'm saying.</i>

815
01:05:31.382 --> 01:05:33.467
Here, look. Take my Rolex.

816
01:05:34.594 --> 01:05:37.806
Ooh, nice watch.

817
01:05:37.848 --> 01:05:40.058
- Is this impact resistant?
- Sure.

818
01:05:41.643 --> 01:05:43.855
You stupid piece of shit!

819
01:05:43.897 --> 01:05:45.982
You stupid fuck. Get up!

820
01:05:46.024 --> 01:05:48.359
Come on. Get up!

821
01:05:52.488 --> 01:05:54.949
Oh, ho. Pain. Pain!

822
01:06:00.163 --> 01:06:03.543
We tried to find a smaller girl
to beat the shit out of you,

823
01:06:03.585 --> 01:06:05.629
but it was short notice.

824
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:07.505
It was short notice!

825
01:06:07.547 --> 01:06:11.301
Oh! Ow! That one had to hurt.

826
01:06:27.193 --> 01:06:29.279
<i>Safety's on.</i>

827
01:06:47.048 --> 01:06:49.259
<i>Come on. Let's go.</i>

828
01:06:50.468 --> 01:06:52.345
Hey, wait!

829
01:06:59.603 --> 01:07:02.481
- I need a drink.
- Lenny, get some rest.

830
01:07:02.523 --> 01:07:05.067
The cops know they'll
never nail this guy

831
01:07:05.109 --> 01:07:07.445
the second they walk in the room.

832
01:07:07.487 --> 01:07:09.948
<i>It's all about
what they see walking in...</i>

833
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:12.867
dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration.

834
01:07:12.909 --> 01:07:17.372
Cops are lazy, and they know nobody
gives a shit about a dead hooker.

835
01:07:17.414 --> 01:07:19.500
They're roadkill, right?

836
01:07:19.542 --> 01:07:22.295
So they'll take pictures, make jokes,

837
01:07:22.336 --> 01:07:25.256
<i>and just shrug it off
like it's a random kill.</i>

838
01:07:25.298 --> 01:07:29.511
<i>- It's the kind you never solve.
- That doesn't add, does it?</i>

839
01:07:29.553 --> 01:07:33.098
Iris said she knew somebody
was after her. That is not random.

840
01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:35.726
If they get me, I...

841
01:07:35.767 --> 01:07:38.270
She said "they". "If THEY get me."

842
01:07:38.312 --> 01:07:42.316
Which means this whole random
sex killer thing is bullshit.

843
01:07:42.357 --> 01:07:46.446
<i>- Somebody whacked her for a reason.
- So this guy's not a psycho?</i>

844
01:07:46.487 --> 01:07:49.074
<i>He's a psycho.
To do what's on that tape,</i>

845
01:07:49.116 --> 01:07:51.660
<i>he's not a well-adjusted human being.</i>

846
01:07:52.411 --> 01:07:54.496
I got to get some sleep.

847
01:07:54.538 --> 01:07:59.335
OK, Lenny. Put that down,
and I'll check on you tomorrow.

848
01:07:59.376 --> 01:08:02.463
Hey, you wanna rub my neck?

849
01:08:02.504 --> 01:08:04.924
<i>My shoulder's real sore.</i>

850
01:08:04.965 --> 01:08:07.720
OK. All right. Come here.

851
01:08:09.972 --> 01:08:12.975
- Right here?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

852
01:08:13.017 --> 01:08:14.685
Ohh...

853
01:08:19.273 --> 01:08:21.150
<i>Don't stop.</i>

854
01:08:21.192 --> 01:08:23.694
<i>How's Zander?</i>

855
01:08:23.736 --> 01:08:25.821
<i>Oh... He's fine.</i>

856
01:08:27.907 --> 01:08:31.078
- I miss him.
- He misses you, too.

857
01:08:32.830 --> 01:08:36.292
<i>I'm real sorry about being
so hard on you earlier.</i>

858
01:08:36.334 --> 01:08:42.465
I just see you getting sucked into
this deeper and deeper, and, um...

859
01:08:42.507 --> 01:08:46.135
Macey, come on.
I know you still love me.

860
01:08:52.851 --> 01:08:55.896
How can you do this
in front of your child?

861
01:08:55.938 --> 01:08:58.024
In front of your son.

862
01:08:58.066 --> 01:09:01.027
- Mace, hold on. Mace...
- In front of your son!

863
01:09:04.114 --> 01:09:05.991
Zander!

864
01:09:07.492 --> 01:09:09.244
Zander!

865
01:09:09.286 --> 01:09:12.248
"When a child loves you
for a long, long time,

866
01:09:12.290 --> 01:09:15.501
"not just to play with,
but really loves you..."

867
01:09:15.543 --> 01:09:17.378
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Mommy!

868
01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:20.298
- This is Lenny.
- Hi.

869
01:09:42.614 --> 01:09:46.075
<i>'Hi, it's Lenny.
Just what do you have in mind? '</i>

870
01:09:47.327 --> 01:09:51.081
<i>'Hey, the last day of the world
and you spend it in bed? '</i>

871
01:09:54.461 --> 01:09:56.796
<i>- What's up, Max?
- Not a whole lot, man.</i>

872
01:09:56.838 --> 01:09:59.674
They've just been saying
words over Jeriko.

873
01:09:59.716 --> 01:10:02.344
<i>Tension's running
pretty high down here.</i>

874
01:10:02.385 --> 01:10:03.929
- Faith OK?
- Yeah.

875
01:10:03.970 --> 01:10:06.640
<i>She's leaving with Gant,
so I got to boogie.</i>

876
01:10:06.681 --> 01:10:11.436
Iris checked into the Regent last
night under a false name. Paid cash.

877
01:10:11.478 --> 01:10:13.649
- So she was hiding out.
- Yep.

878
01:10:13.690 --> 01:10:16.610
I heard you dropped in
on Gant last night.

879
01:10:16.652 --> 01:10:20.530
<i>- 'Another slick Lenny move, huh? '
- He's in this somehow.</i>

880
01:10:20.572 --> 01:10:23.283
<i>'Just stay close to Faith, OK? '</i>

881
01:10:23.325 --> 01:10:25.369
No worries, bro. I gotta jam.

882
01:13:26.983 --> 01:13:29.068
What up, Lenny?

883
01:13:29.986 --> 01:13:32.071
- So, where we going?
- Anywhere.

884
01:13:32.113 --> 01:13:35.826
<i>- You're acting strange, what's up?
- Shh, Mace.</i>

885
01:13:35.868 --> 01:13:38.370
We'll talk about it in the car.

886
01:13:40.081 --> 01:13:41.958
Hand me that box of tapes.

887
01:13:54.471 --> 01:13:57.015
<i>- Oh, shit.
- What's the matter?</i>

888
01:13:57.057 --> 01:13:59.143
<i>This tie doesn't go with blue.</i>

889
01:14:07.069 --> 01:14:09.655
Lenny, would you relax?

890
01:14:09.696 --> 01:14:11.782
We're not being followed.

891
01:14:11.823 --> 01:14:16.078
- Stop being so paranoid.
- The guy had a knife to my throat

892
01:14:16.119 --> 01:14:17.329
in my living-room.

893
01:14:18.497 --> 01:14:21.417
Relaxing might be right out, OK?

894
01:14:43.984 --> 01:14:48.906
Oh, man. Oh, that is one
unbelievable piece of eye-fuck.

895
01:14:48.948 --> 01:14:52.743
Skip the art criticism, Tick. What
can you tell me about the wearer?

896
01:14:52.785 --> 01:14:55.246
That guy is fucked up.

897
01:14:55.288 --> 01:14:57.832
- We know that.
- He has some distortion

898
01:14:57.873 --> 01:14:59.750
in the visual cortex.

899
01:14:59.792 --> 01:15:03.880
The colour and grey-scale values
are messed up, like colour-blindness.

900
01:15:03.922 --> 01:15:08.302
See the peak period ratios? There
could be a tumour or brain lesion.

901
01:15:08.343 --> 01:15:12.347
<i>Whoever's doing this is using a box
to split the signal...</i>

902
01:15:12.389 --> 01:15:16.603
<i>- Ever make a box like that?
- A few. I can't see if it's mine.</i>

903
01:15:17.562 --> 01:15:19.647
<i>I don't like this.</i>

904
01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:22.901
- This is not good.
- What?

905
01:15:22.943 --> 01:15:26.030
<i>It's cutting close to me.
She was just here, man!</i>

906
01:15:26.071 --> 01:15:28.115
- Who?
- Iris!

907
01:15:28.157 --> 01:15:30.701
- Iris was here?
- She was shaking like a junkie,

908
01:15:30.743 --> 01:15:33.495
saying she wanted me
to copy some clip.

909
01:15:33.537 --> 01:15:35.956
<i>- What clip?
- I don't know.</i>

910
01:15:35.998 --> 01:15:39.419
<i>She said I wouldn't wanna see it.
She was gonna give it to you.</i>

911
01:15:39.461 --> 01:15:43.549
- She never gave me a tape.
- Think back to what she said.

912
01:15:43.591 --> 01:15:47.428
She came in. She was crying.
She wanted to go to my car.

913
01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:50.181
<i>Let's go to your car.
There's something you have to see.</i>

914
01:15:50.222 --> 01:15:51.265
- Something about my car.
- In your car.

915
01:16:06.574 --> 01:16:09.535
<i>That's a handy little
attitude adjuster.</i>

916
01:16:22.173 --> 01:16:24.384
<i>Damn. I'm boxed in.</i>

917
01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:50.955
<i>- What's it say?
- Nothing.</i>

918
01:16:50.997 --> 01:16:53.417
<i>Let's go play this back.</i>

919
01:16:57.713 --> 01:17:02.009
<i>- Give us the tape right now.
- I'm just tryin' to get my car back.</i>

920
01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:04.094
Shut the fuck up.

921
01:17:04.136 --> 01:17:07.307
<i>- Give him the tape.
- It's in my case.</i>

922
01:17:07.348 --> 01:17:10.184
<i>I'm gonna open my case.</i>

923
01:17:10.435 --> 01:17:12.979
Facing us, so we can see it.

924
01:17:25.409 --> 01:17:27.996
Take it and turn her loose, OK?

925
01:17:28.038 --> 01:17:30.123
Yeah. Absolutely.

926
01:17:57.361 --> 01:18:01.114
"Oh, no. No.
We're not being followed, Lenny."

927
01:18:01.156 --> 01:18:02.866
<i>"Don't be paranoid. "</i>

928
01:18:34.902 --> 01:18:36.696
Shit!

929
01:18:36.737 --> 01:18:41.325
- The glass is bullet-resistant.
- Whatever happened to bulletproof?

930
01:18:43.077 --> 01:18:44.453
Shit!

931
01:18:44.495 --> 01:18:46.747
Calm down. This is what I do.

932
01:18:52.838 --> 01:18:54.923
Hang on!

933
01:19:22.119 --> 01:19:23.413
Christ.

934
01:19:53.404 --> 01:19:55.031
Shit!

935
01:19:58.910 --> 01:20:01.245
God damn it. 911 is busy.

936
01:20:01.287 --> 01:20:03.164
<i>It's all right, Lenny.</i>

937
01:20:03.206 --> 01:20:05.375
<i>They'd never make it in time.</i>

938
01:20:12.465 --> 01:20:16.179
<i>It won't open!
Oh, you're crazy.</i>

939
01:20:40.914 --> 01:20:41.957
Oh, God!

940
01:20:44.126 --> 01:20:47.296
<i>- This is bad.
- The gas tank's gonna go any second.</i>

941
01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:55.763
Hold on.

942
01:21:07.151 --> 01:21:09.611
Are you out of your fucking mind?

943
01:21:09.653 --> 01:21:12.281
<i>The fire is out, isn't it?</i>

944
01:21:17.746 --> 01:21:19.831
Get in here, Lenny.

945
01:21:19.873 --> 01:21:21.916
Come on! Move it! Move!

946
01:21:41.897 --> 01:21:44.316
Get ready to hold your breath.

947
01:21:44.358 --> 01:21:47.736
Just kick out hard
and follow me, OK?

948
01:22:02.336 --> 01:22:04.463
<i>Let's get out of here.</i>

949
01:22:17.979 --> 01:22:22.108
<i>I can't believe you had to give
them the damn tape.</i>

950
01:22:22.149 --> 01:22:24.360
Yeah. Me neither.

951
01:22:24.402 --> 01:22:26.529
It was one of my favourites.

952
01:22:26.570 --> 01:22:29.699
Me and Faith in the hot tub
on my birthday.

953
01:22:32.576 --> 01:22:34.662
Are we impressed yet?

954
01:22:34.704 --> 01:22:36.789
Yeah.

955
01:22:36.831 --> 01:22:38.917
Pretty impressed.

956
01:22:38.959 --> 01:22:42.129
# Here we kitty come, come,
here we kitty come, come... #

957
01:22:42.170 --> 01:22:46.134
<i>Well, I'm missing the party of the
century, hauling your asses around...</i>

958
01:22:46.175 --> 01:22:50.596
- Hey, Curtis. Just drive, all right?
- This shit is wack.

959
01:22:50.638 --> 01:22:53.766
- Those two guys were cops.
- You sure?

960
01:22:53.808 --> 01:22:57.979
<i>It's the walk. Anyway, they'll get
your address. We got to keep moving.</i>

961
01:23:00.065 --> 01:23:03.819
# ... that crawls through the cracks,
you love that red, white... #

962
01:23:03.861 --> 01:23:06.697
What you doing all wet?

963
01:23:06.739 --> 01:23:10.285
<i>What's up? Zander, we're going
to Aunt Cecile's house.</i>

964
01:23:10.327 --> 01:23:13.288
- We'll see the fireworks from there.
- Aw, Ma.

965
01:23:13.330 --> 01:23:15.457
Come on, boy. Chop chop.

966
01:23:15.498 --> 01:23:19.462
Come on, Zander.
We're going for a ride, OK?

967
01:23:24.508 --> 01:23:28.638
<i>- I want to know what's going on.
- Get in the car, Cecile...</i>

968
01:23:28.679 --> 01:23:30.765
<i>- What's goin' on?
- Now.</i>

969
01:23:47.116 --> 01:23:50.244
<i>Yo, what's up? How y'all doing?</i>

970
01:23:51.871 --> 01:23:54.374
<i>- Yo, Mace. What's up?
- Hey, Ronnie.</i>

971
01:23:54.415 --> 01:23:57.711
<i>- You never come around here no more.
- I'm working, brother.</i>

972
01:23:57.753 --> 01:24:00.714
<i>- This is Lenny. He's with me.
- What's up?</i>

973
01:24:00.756 --> 01:24:04.344
- Watch the fireworks, baby.
- How you guys doing?

974
01:24:08.431 --> 01:24:10.558
- Hey.
- Hey.

975
01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:12.686
Good seeing you.

976
01:25:08.621 --> 01:25:10.707
Tell me.

977
01:25:10.749 --> 01:25:12.835
<i>I can't tell you.</i>

978
01:25:12.877 --> 01:25:16.088
<i>- You gotta see it.
- I'm not doing it.</i>

979
01:25:16.130 --> 01:25:20.926
I know what you think about
the wire, but you gotta see it.

980
01:25:20.968 --> 01:25:23.054
<i>It's that important.</i>

981
01:25:34.024 --> 01:25:36.109
OK?

982
01:25:42.784 --> 01:25:45.913
<i>I'm sorry this has to be
your first playback.</i>

983
01:25:48.499 --> 01:25:52.002
<i>It's all right. Keep your eyes
closed, or you'll see double.</i>

984
01:25:57.716 --> 01:26:01.345
Mm, baby, yes!

985
01:26:02.471 --> 01:26:06.936
I wanna thank you, Jeriko!
I owe you one for this, my brother.

986
01:26:06.977 --> 01:26:10.272
<i>You owe me two,
you bastard. That's right!</i>

987
01:26:10.314 --> 01:26:13.651
I owe you three,
four, five, and six!

988
01:26:13.693 --> 01:26:15.778
Hey, baby.

989
01:26:16.821 --> 01:26:19.281
<i>What you doin' back there?</i>

990
01:26:21.117 --> 01:26:24.078
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Oh, yeah, baby.

991
01:26:25.621 --> 01:26:29.002
Lights! Damn. Look at this, man.

992
01:26:29.043 --> 01:26:33.172
- Oh, god damn, man!
- Hey, just be cool, Jeriko. Yo.

993
01:26:33.214 --> 01:26:37.552
<i>Slow down.
I'm not speeding, man.</i>

994
01:26:37.593 --> 01:26:41.347
<i>Man, what's the matter?
A black man can't own no jeep, huh?</i>

995
01:26:41.389 --> 01:26:44.642
Pull all the way
to the foot of the ramp.

996
01:26:44.684 --> 01:26:46.352
No problem.

997
01:26:46.394 --> 01:26:50.065
You know how it is.
If we be cool, they gonna be cool.

998
01:26:50.107 --> 01:26:52.317
<i>I can't afford no trouble.</i>

999
01:26:52.359 --> 01:26:54.446
<i>I'm upset.</i>

1000
01:26:55.989 --> 01:26:58.450
<i>A man can't do shit in this town.</i>

1001
01:26:58.491 --> 01:27:03.246
<i>I ain't going back, Iris. I don't
give a fuck. I ain't going back.</i>

1002
01:27:03.288 --> 01:27:06.166
Driver,
step out of the vehicle.

1003
01:27:06.207 --> 01:27:10.963
Get down on your knees. Put
your hands behind your head... now!

1004
01:27:11.005 --> 01:27:14.133
Everyone else,
out of the car.

1005
01:27:18.347 --> 01:27:22.059
Damn, man. What the hell
you pull me over for?

1006
01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:24.519
<i>If I went slower,
I'd have been parked.</i>

1007
01:27:24.561 --> 01:27:28.023
Get down on your knees,
put your hands behind your head.

1008
01:27:28.941 --> 01:27:31.027
Put your hands on
the hood of the car.

1009
01:27:31.069 --> 01:27:33.196
<i>Don't move. You, too.</i>

1010
01:27:33.237 --> 01:27:37.992
I suppose you had suspects fitting
our description in the area.

1011
01:27:38.034 --> 01:27:43.290
Is that it? What was the description?
Two black males in a car?

1012
01:27:43.332 --> 01:27:44.958
Right

1013
01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.252
Ow! Fuck!

1014
01:27:47.294 --> 01:27:51.633
You know what? You pulled over the
wrong black male tonight, officer...

1015
01:27:51.675 --> 01:27:54.427
What is it? Steckler.
Officer Steckler!

1016
01:27:54.469 --> 01:27:56.846
<i>I'm that 800-pound
gorilla in your mist.</i>

1017
01:27:56.888 --> 01:28:00.558
I make more money in a day
than you make in a whole year.

1018
01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:02.686
My lawyer loves spending my money

1019
01:28:02.727 --> 01:28:06.064
dragging Aryan, Robocop fuckers
like you into court.

1020
01:28:06.106 --> 01:28:09.569
Get a man down on the ground
with no probable cause.

1021
01:28:09.611 --> 01:28:12.072
- Shut the fuck up.
- He didn't...

1022
01:28:12.114 --> 01:28:14.574
Shut up and get back over there!

1023
01:28:14.616 --> 01:28:17.536
- You all right, man?
- Motherfucker kicked me, man.

1024
01:28:17.577 --> 01:28:21.081
<i>- It's that rap-ass.
- You're that rapper puke.</i>

1025
01:28:21.123 --> 01:28:22.916
Jeriko One?

1026
01:28:22.958 --> 01:28:27.337
<i>You're the one that's been getting
all the gangbangers together,</i>

1027
01:28:27.379 --> 01:28:29.756
forming citizen groups,

1028
01:28:29.798 --> 01:28:32.761
trying to rake the LAPD
over a cheese grater?

1029
01:28:32.803 --> 01:28:36.306
<i>Yeah. That's right.
And you gonna be in my next song.</i>

1030
01:28:36.348 --> 01:28:38.767
<i>It's gonna be called Robo-Steckler.</i>

1031
01:28:38.809 --> 01:28:42.771
<i>It's all about a cop
who met his worst nightmare,</i>

1032
01:28:42.813 --> 01:28:47.985
a nigger with enough political juice
to scrunch his ass like a stink bug.

1033
01:28:48.027 --> 01:28:52.115
<i>- You gonna be famous, fucker!
- I don't think so.</i>

1034
01:28:55.285 --> 01:28:57.537
Stop that bitch!

1035
01:28:58.956 --> 01:29:01.042
Oh, no!

1036
01:29:02.376 --> 01:29:05.671
- Get her!
- Oh, no. Fuck.

1037
01:29:18.101 --> 01:29:20.312
There she goes! Get her!

1038
01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:26.486
You bitch!

1039
01:29:49.427 --> 01:29:51.513
Hang on. Hang on, Max.

1040
01:29:53.557 --> 01:29:54.892
Mace.

1041
01:29:56.102 --> 01:29:58.187
You see?

1042
01:29:59.772 --> 01:30:01.649
You had to see it.

1043
01:30:01.691 --> 01:30:06.028
I see the world opening up
and swallowing us all.

1044
01:30:06.070 --> 01:30:08.155
Yeah. I know.

1045
01:30:09.824 --> 01:30:11.492
Max, are you there?

1046
01:30:11.534 --> 01:30:14.664
<i>Meet me at Tick's in half an hour.
And, Lenny...</i>

1047
01:30:14.706 --> 01:30:16.791
<i>Don't get pulled over, OK?</i>

1048
01:30:18.584 --> 01:30:21.337
Do you know what this tape could do
if it got out?

1049
01:30:21.838 --> 01:30:24.590
Yeah, I got a pretty good idea.

1050
01:30:24.632 --> 01:30:26.843
People finding out...

1051
01:30:28.011 --> 01:30:29.679
seeing...

1052
01:30:30.638 --> 01:30:34.643
that the LAPD just flat-out
executed Jeriko One.

1053
01:30:35.602 --> 01:30:37.479
Jesus.

1054
01:30:38.690 --> 01:30:40.150
Jesus.

1055
01:30:42.027 --> 01:30:46.322
- Maybe they ought to see.
- Maybe.

1056
01:30:46.364 --> 01:30:49.284
<i>But tonight's probably not
the best night.</i>

1057
01:30:57.793 --> 01:31:01.589
Mace... Come on. We're rolling.

1058
01:31:09.681 --> 01:31:14.561
<i>I don't think those cops did Iris.
Whoever Iris wore for killed her.</i>

1059
01:31:14.603 --> 01:31:16.397
- Why?
- To break the trail.

1060
01:31:16.439 --> 01:31:18.483
If those cops had gotten her,

1061
01:31:18.524 --> 01:31:22.528
<i>they'd have found out who she was
wearing for and gone after them.</i>

1062
01:31:22.570 --> 01:31:27.617
Our killer is as scared as we are,
which makes him really dangerous,

1063
01:31:27.658 --> 01:31:29.703
judging by how scared I am.

1064
01:31:32.664 --> 01:31:34.875
Move it up.

1065
01:31:44.094 --> 01:31:46.221
Let her go.

1066
01:32:00.112 --> 01:32:02.823
<i>Sounds like Tick's
already celebrating, huh?</i>

1067
01:32:02.864 --> 01:32:07.911
- You're overdressed for this party.
- I want to look nice for you, Lenny.

1068
01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:10.956
Hey, Tick. I gotta talk to you.

1069
01:32:31.145 --> 01:32:33.439
<i>He's been cooked off.</i>

1070
01:32:34.565 --> 01:32:36.108
- Is he dead?
- No.

1071
01:32:36.150 --> 01:32:38.569
But his frontal lobes
are like runny eggs.

1072
01:32:38.610 --> 01:32:43.701
They use an amplifier to boost
the signal, and it fries his brain.

1073
01:32:43.743 --> 01:32:45.619
Tick!

1074
01:32:47.204 --> 01:32:48.664
<i>It's Lenny!</i>

1075
01:32:48.706 --> 01:32:50.750
Hey, Tick! Come on!

1076
01:32:50.791 --> 01:32:53.169
<i>Tick, it's me, Lenny!</i>

1077
01:32:53.210 --> 01:32:55.880
Come on. Wake up. Tick!

1078
01:32:55.921 --> 01:32:57.631
Come on!

1079
01:32:57.673 --> 01:33:00.510
Come on, Tick! Come on!

1080
01:33:00.552 --> 01:33:03.722
<i>He's totally cut off
from the outside world.</i>

1081
01:33:03.764 --> 01:33:06.475
How long does it last?

1082
01:33:06.516 --> 01:33:07.810
Forever.

1083
01:33:09.312 --> 01:33:11.981
Those psycho cops are on
a slash-and-burn

1084
01:33:12.023 --> 01:33:14.525
to find the tape
and cover their tracks.

1085
01:33:14.567 --> 01:33:16.652
Since Tick is a duplicator,

1086
01:33:16.694 --> 01:33:20.156
they wanna find out if copies were
made or who wired Iris.

1087
01:33:20.198 --> 01:33:23.702
<i>It's not even homicide,
since he's technically alive.</i>

1088
01:33:23.744 --> 01:33:26.705
<i>Yeah. That's right.
He's technically alive.</i>

1089
01:33:26.747 --> 01:33:29.792
It seems sophisticated.
These are not subtle guys.

1090
01:33:29.833 --> 01:33:33.338
<i>- There's more to this.
- What do you mean?</i>

1091
01:33:34.422 --> 01:33:39.886
<i>All I'm saying is, you don't know how
high up the food chain this goes.</i>

1092
01:33:39.928 --> 01:33:42.556
- I heard stuff.
- What stuff?

1093
01:33:42.598 --> 01:33:47.228
I heard stuff, smoke, rumours.
I've heard stuff.

1094
01:33:47.269 --> 01:33:50.481
I've heard stuff
about a death squad.

1095
01:33:50.523 --> 01:33:55.027
They're a group of guys, cops,
loyal to the hard-line school.

1096
01:33:55.069 --> 01:33:58.949
Guys who've had too many years
of City Hall, review boards,

1097
01:33:58.990 --> 01:34:01.869
and the goddam media
pissing down their necks,

1098
01:34:01.911 --> 01:34:04.580
suspending cops, tying their hands,

1099
01:34:04.622 --> 01:34:08.751
while these same people
are squealing, "Save us! Save us!

1100
01:34:08.793 --> 01:34:12.213
"Do something, you morons.
Crime is out of control."

1101
01:34:17.135 --> 01:34:21.764
<i>- Bullshit. It's conspiracy paranoia.
- It's not about if you're paranoid.</i>

1102
01:34:21.806 --> 01:34:24.310
<i>It's about whether
you're paranoid enough.</i>

1103
01:34:24.352 --> 01:34:26.354
Christ.

1104
01:34:26.396 --> 01:34:28.273
Exactly. Get religion.

1105
01:34:28.314 --> 01:34:30.442
I love you like my own blood, Lenny,

1106
01:34:30.483 --> 01:34:32.902
<i>but don't walk near me in public.</i>

1107
01:34:32.944 --> 01:34:36.656
The only card we got is the tape.
Get it to the media.

1108
01:34:36.698 --> 01:34:38.450
Right.

1109
01:34:38.491 --> 01:34:42.454
You run that on the news, by midnight
you got the biggest riot ever.

1110
01:34:42.495 --> 01:34:44.582
They'll see the smoke from Canada.

1111
01:34:44.623 --> 01:34:47.543
<i>What are you saying?
Pretend it didn't happen?</i>

1112
01:34:47.585 --> 01:34:49.921
<i>- I didn't say that.
- It happened.</i>

1113
01:34:49.963 --> 01:34:52.549
The LAPD executed
an important black man.

1114
01:34:52.591 --> 01:34:55.218
Who are you to try to bury it?

1115
01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:59.097
...trying to rake the LAPD
over a cheese grater?

1116
01:34:59.139 --> 01:35:03.185
You want blood running waist-deep
in the storm drains, go do it.

1117
01:35:03.226 --> 01:35:07.899
200,000 gangbangers will burn this
city to the fucking ground, Mace.

1118
01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:11.819
Once the fire starts, the cops'll
cap off anything that moves.

1119
01:35:11.861 --> 01:35:14.114
It'll be an all-out war.

1120
01:35:14.156 --> 01:35:15.491
<i>I don't think so.</i>

1121
01:35:15.532 --> 01:35:17.743
<i>Maybe it's time for a war.</i>

1122
01:35:17.785 --> 01:35:21.497
You really want that
on your head, Mace, huh?

1123
01:35:21.538 --> 01:35:23.624
Really?

1124
01:35:24.208 --> 01:35:29.089
<i>Whoever did Iris did Tick.
It's the same sick wirehead shit.</i>

1125
01:35:29.130 --> 01:35:31.466
<i>It's the same reason
to burn the trail.</i>

1126
01:35:31.508 --> 01:35:34.052
If Faith knows anything about this,

1127
01:35:34.094 --> 01:35:35.970
<i>- and she does...
- Somebody's going to kill Faith?</i>

1128
01:35:38.641 --> 01:35:40.935
# Yeah, you're not rid of me

1129
01:35:40.976 --> 01:35:44.939
# No, you're not rid of me

1130
01:35:44.980 --> 01:35:49.069
# I'll make you lick my injuries

1131
01:35:49.111 --> 01:35:51.321
# I wanna twist your head off, see?

1132
01:35:51.363 --> 01:35:56.785
<i># Till you say don't you wish
you never, never met her?</i>

1133
01:35:56.827 --> 01:36:00.288
<i># Don't you, don't you wish
you never, never met her?</i>

1134
01:36:00.539 --> 01:36:04.085
<i># Don't you, don't you wish
you never, never met her?</i>

1135
01:36:04.335 --> 01:36:07.589
<i># Don't you, don't you wish
you never, never met her?</i>

1136
01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:11.635
<i># Don't you, don't you wish
you never, never met her?</i>

1137
01:36:11.885 --> 01:36:15.806
<i># Don't you, don't you wish
you never, never met her?</i>

1138
01:36:15.848 --> 01:36:20.477
<i># Don't you, don't you wish
you never, never met her? #</i>

1139
01:36:35.077 --> 01:36:38.039
Jesus, Lenny, you scared
the fuck out of me!

1140
01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:40.916
- What do you want?
- We know about Jeriko.

1141
01:36:40.958 --> 01:36:46.380
- Iris gave me a copy of the tape.
- I wanted to keep you out of this.

1142
01:36:46.422 --> 01:36:50.177
- How did it happen?
- Why was Iris with Jeriko, wired up?

1143
01:36:50.218 --> 01:36:52.721
Faith, listen...
Look at me. Look at me.

1144
01:36:52.764 --> 01:36:55.725
You gotta trust us.
We're here to help you.

1145
01:36:55.767 --> 01:36:58.686
All right. I'll talk to you alone.

1146
01:36:58.728 --> 01:37:01.314
- Mace is in this.
- Tell us.

1147
01:37:03.066 --> 01:37:04.317
Faith.

1148
01:37:08.112 --> 01:37:11.658
<i>Philo, he's gotten
obsessed with playback.</i>

1149
01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:13.952
<i>He's a total wiretrip junkie.</i>

1150
01:37:13.994 --> 01:37:18.041
<i>He's such a control freak now,
he's been having people followed,</i>

1151
01:37:18.083 --> 01:37:20.460
<i>recording his business partners'
calls,</i>

1152
01:37:20.502 --> 01:37:22.587
wiring up people left and right.

1153
01:37:24.255 --> 01:37:26.341
<i>Philo and Jeriko weren't getting on.</i>

1154
01:37:26.383 --> 01:37:29.428
<i>He was afraid Jeriko would dump him,
but he wasn't sure,</i>

1155
01:37:29.470 --> 01:37:31.555
so he starts with the surveillance.

1156
01:37:31.597 --> 01:37:34.392
A couple of nights ago,
he wires up Iris,

1157
01:37:34.433 --> 01:37:39.814
<i>and he sends her and the other girl,
Diamanda, over to Jeriko's table.</i>

1158
01:37:42.024 --> 01:37:43.902
Hi, baby.

1159
01:37:43.944 --> 01:37:46.405
Hi. My name is Iris.

1160
01:37:46.446 --> 01:37:48.490
Hey.

1161
01:37:48.532 --> 01:37:50.827
I got a present for you.

1162
01:37:50.868 --> 01:37:53.246
<i>And it's so beautiful.</i>

1163
01:37:54.831 --> 01:37:58.960
<i>So that night, Iris calls up crying.
She's freaking out.</i>

1164
01:37:59.001 --> 01:38:01.546
She comes over
and she plays the tape.

1165
01:38:01.587 --> 01:38:05.883
<i>Philo loses it. He can't believe
the disaster she's gotten him into.</i>

1166
01:38:05.925 --> 01:38:08.971
<i>'He's afraid the cops
will beat it out of her</i>

1167
01:38:09.012 --> 01:38:12.600
<i>'who she's been working for,
and then come looking for him. '</i>

1168
01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:17.564
Why not go public,
save himself that way?

1169
01:38:17.605 --> 01:38:21.735
<i>If it got out he spied on his own
artists he'd lose all his other acts,</i>

1170
01:38:21.776 --> 01:38:23.903
<i>and it'd be over for him.</i>

1171
01:38:45.552 --> 01:38:47.721
<i>'So he gives Iris some money. '</i>

1172
01:38:47.763 --> 01:38:51.933
He tells her to check into a hotel
under an assumed name

1173
01:38:51.976 --> 01:38:55.605
- until he can figure out what to do.
- He figured it out, all right.

1174
01:38:55.646 --> 01:38:58.776
- You think he killed her?
- The killer knew where she was

1175
01:38:58.817 --> 01:39:00.903
because he put her there.

1176
01:39:01.737 --> 01:39:03.781
What a nightmare.

1177
01:39:03.822 --> 01:39:07.159
<i>I don't know where the fuck she is,
but we're late. Let's go.</i>

1178
01:39:07.201 --> 01:39:11.789
Philo, how do you want me to work it
tonight at the Bonaventure?

1179
01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:14.042
Downstairs, or upstairs at the suite?

1180
01:39:14.084 --> 01:39:15.418
Lenny.

1181
01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:18.421
Leave here with me right now.

1182
01:39:20.298 --> 01:39:21.341
Come on.

1183
01:39:21.383 --> 01:39:25.096
- We'll talk about that later.
- No, man. I need to know.

1184
01:39:25.137 --> 01:39:28.974
Joey, what the fuck you waiting for?
Get her. Go!

1185
01:39:29.016 --> 01:39:31.811
I just say things once, baby, OK?

1186
01:39:31.852 --> 01:39:34.481
So, we will talk about that... later.

1187
01:39:34.523 --> 01:39:37.818
<i>Oh, OK, man. I'm cool. I'm cool.
I'm sorry, man.</i>

1188
01:39:37.859 --> 01:39:40.404
Hey, Wade, go out for a pass, bro.

1189
01:39:44.032 --> 01:39:46.284
# Blue sky

1190
01:39:47.452 --> 01:39:52.250
# No white clouds
in my blue sky #

1191
01:40:02.344 --> 01:40:05.514
<i>- Oh, shit!
- Get out of my fuckin' way!</i>

1192
01:40:07.641 --> 01:40:09.810
Come on! Come on!

1193
01:40:09.852 --> 01:40:12.563
Lenny! Go! Go!

1194
01:40:15.484 --> 01:40:17.820
Pardon me! Sorry! Sorry!

1195
01:40:17.862 --> 01:40:20.197
<i>Get out of my fuckin' way! Move it!</i>

1196
01:40:20.239 --> 01:40:21.365
Move!

1197
01:40:21.407 --> 01:40:22.867
Faith.

1198
01:40:23.826 --> 01:40:25.911
Hello, Lenny, you fuck!

1199
01:40:28.914 --> 01:40:31.709
<i>Let's go, darling. Happy New Year!</i>

1200
01:40:42.138 --> 01:40:44.724
- Get out of the way!
- Lenny...

1201
01:40:44.766 --> 01:40:47.935
Excuse me. Get out of my fucking way!

1202
01:40:51.439 --> 01:40:54.734
Vita... Vita, not now, baby.

1203
01:40:54.776 --> 01:40:57.237
Come on. Not here.

1204
01:41:20.096 --> 01:41:21.972
There he is.

1205
01:41:22.014 --> 01:41:25.226
Mr Gant, a few questions, sir?

1206
01:41:37.030 --> 01:41:39.992
<i>Well, I'm certainly
in the mood for a party</i>

1207
01:41:40.034 --> 01:41:43.788
- Wade, take her up to the suite.
- No problem.

1208
01:41:43.830 --> 01:41:48.000
You go and have a glass
of champagne... or six.

1209
01:41:48.042 --> 01:41:52.213
See you up there in a bit,
help you ring in the new year.

1210
01:41:55.259 --> 01:41:57.344
I live for the moment.

1211
01:41:58.930 --> 01:42:01.766
Pussy-whipped,
sorry-ass motherfucker.

1212
01:42:01.808 --> 01:42:03.685
Take it easy.

1213
01:42:03.768 --> 01:42:06.563
So... So where are they now?

1214
01:42:06.604 --> 01:42:09.524
<i>He's got her up in
the room, under guard.</i>

1215
01:42:09.566 --> 01:42:12.360
<i>Uh, he's still working the party,</i>

1216
01:42:12.402 --> 01:42:14.738
<i>acting smooth like nothing's nothing.</i>

1217
01:42:14.779 --> 01:42:17.449
So, buddy... I say we work a trade.

1218
01:42:17.490 --> 01:42:20.036
- What do you mean?
- Give him the clip.

1219
01:42:20.078 --> 01:42:23.415
The tape for Faith.
I know he'll go for it.

1220
01:42:23.457 --> 01:42:26.626
This is what we laughingly
refer to as a plan?

1221
01:42:26.668 --> 01:42:28.754
Just get your butt down here.

1222
01:42:28.795 --> 01:42:33.300
<i>If I'm not downstairs, go to
the room. It's 2203. You writing?</i>

1223
01:42:33.341 --> 01:42:36.636
2-2-0-3.

1224
01:42:36.678 --> 01:42:39.639
If he gives us any shit...
we kill them all.

1225
01:42:39.681 --> 01:42:42.811
What do you say?
Really scatter the pigeons.

1226
01:42:42.853 --> 01:42:45.314
We got to get over there.

1227
01:42:45.355 --> 01:42:48.484
Can you borrow a dress
from Cecile or something?

1228
01:42:48.525 --> 01:42:51.320
<i>- I'm not going.
- What do you mean?</i>

1229
01:42:51.361 --> 01:42:54.656
<i>- Gant's going to do her right there.
- Shut up.</i>

1230
01:42:54.698 --> 01:42:58.869
<i>Lenny, park your mouth and listen.
It's a set-up. Think about it.</i>

1231
01:42:58.911 --> 01:43:00.997
Why is he sending tapes to you?

1232
01:43:01.039 --> 01:43:04.626
To freak you, get you to rush in,
put a bullet in you, one in her,

1233
01:43:04.667 --> 01:43:09.006
<i>- and the gun in your hand?
- Yeah, that sounds right. I'm going.</i>

1234
01:43:09.048 --> 01:43:12.426
You going to get yourself killed
for this? Huh?

1235
01:43:12.468 --> 01:43:14.553
For this toxic-waste bitch?

1236
01:43:14.595 --> 01:43:16.806
What the fuck are you doing?

1237
01:43:21.812 --> 01:43:25.357
This is your life!
Right here! Right now!

1238
01:43:25.398 --> 01:43:29.027
<i>It's real time, you hear me?
Real time!</i>

1239
01:43:29.069 --> 01:43:32.865
Time to get real, not playback.
You understand me?

1240
01:43:32.907 --> 01:43:34.992
<i>She doesn't love you any more.</i>

1241
01:43:35.034 --> 01:43:38.079
<i>Maybe she did once,
but she doesn't now.</i>

1242
01:43:38.121 --> 01:43:41.124
These are used emotions.

1243
01:43:41.165 --> 01:43:43.585
<i>It's time to trade them in.</i>

1244
01:43:43.627 --> 01:43:46.296
Memories were meant to fade, Lenny.

1245
01:43:46.338 --> 01:43:50.050
They're designed that way
for a reason.

1246
01:43:53.137 --> 01:43:56.348
Have you ever been in love with...

1247
01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:59.727
<i>someone who didn't return that love?</i>

1248
01:44:00.854 --> 01:44:02.940
Yeah, Lenny...

1249
01:44:03.732 --> 01:44:06.193
I have.

1250
01:44:06.235 --> 01:44:09.780
<i>Didn't stop you from
loving them, right?</i>

1251
01:44:09.822 --> 01:44:14.660
Or being able to understand them
or forgive them?

1252
01:44:16.912 --> 01:44:18.998
I guess.

1253
01:44:20.124 --> 01:44:25.339
<i>Didn't stop you from wanting
to protect them... did it?</i>

1254
01:44:33.848 --> 01:44:37.268
When I met Faith,
she was just another...

1255
01:44:37.310 --> 01:44:39.395
another runaway...

1256
01:44:39.437 --> 01:44:42.356
giving $20 blow jobs to buy crank.

1257
01:44:44.234 --> 01:44:46.570
Just another lost soul.

1258
01:44:48.490 --> 01:44:52.327
And she had this voice that was...

1259
01:44:52.368 --> 01:44:54.454
Well, that was scary.

1260
01:44:55.580 --> 01:44:59.417
Like she could take all the hurt
and rage of the entire world

1261
01:44:59.459 --> 01:45:01.961
and lift it up to heaven
in one voice.

1262
01:45:03.046 --> 01:45:05.800
I helped her.

1263
01:45:05.841 --> 01:45:10.971
And I promised her that I'll always
just be there...

1264
01:45:11.013 --> 01:45:13.100
to protect her.

1265
01:45:15.811 --> 01:45:19.397
<i>See, it's not about what's in
her head. It's about what's in mine.</i>

1266
01:45:19.439 --> 01:45:22.484
<i>I can't let go of the promise.</i>

1267
01:45:23.151 --> 01:45:26.531
<i>It's like it's all I have left.</i>

1268
01:45:37.667 --> 01:45:39.753
<i>No, it's not.</i>

1269
01:45:52.350 --> 01:45:54.436
Come on.

1270
01:45:55.228 --> 01:45:57.313
<i>Let's go to a party.</i>

1271
01:47:10.519 --> 01:47:13.021
The end of the world, yeah!

1272
01:47:17.275 --> 01:47:19.153
Shit!

1273
01:47:19.821 --> 01:47:21.906
<i>Let's bail.</i>

1274
01:47:28.663 --> 01:47:30.541
Hey, Mace...

1275
01:47:30.582 --> 01:47:33.460
You look great in that dress.

1276
01:47:33.502 --> 01:47:36.922
- I mean, better than I would.
- Thank you, I think.

1277
01:47:36.964 --> 01:47:38.882
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

1278
01:48:04.452 --> 01:48:08.457
<i>What's your plan for getting into
the most sold-out party in history?</i>

1279
01:48:08.498 --> 01:48:11.001
Relax, Mace. This is what I do.

1280
01:48:30.146 --> 01:48:32.691
- You see Gant?
- Uh-uh.

1281
01:48:42.410 --> 01:48:44.245
Shit.

1282
01:48:54.256 --> 01:48:58.094
Come on, Max. Come on, buddy.

1283
01:48:58.136 --> 01:48:59.930
Come on...

1284
01:48:59.971 --> 01:49:03.892
<i>'The customer you have called
is unavailable... '</i>

1285
01:49:03.934 --> 01:49:08.897
I still got one ace to play. Gant has
what I want, I have what he wants.

1286
01:49:08.939 --> 01:49:11.191
This is the original.

1287
01:49:11.233 --> 01:49:13.151
<i>That's why it's a makable deal.</i>

1288
01:49:13.193 --> 01:49:16.864
Look, this tape is
a lightning bolt from God.

1289
01:49:16.906 --> 01:49:19.534
<i>It's worth more than you,
more than me,</i>

1290
01:49:19.575 --> 01:49:22.745
and more than Faith,
you understand?

1291
01:49:22.788 --> 01:49:25.082
It can change things
that need changing

1292
01:49:25.124 --> 01:49:27.376
before we all go off
the end of the road.

1293
01:49:27.417 --> 01:49:30.671
You do not have the right
to use it for currency.

1294
01:49:30.712 --> 01:49:34.133
So if you go... you go alone.

1295
01:49:34.174 --> 01:49:38.888
You see, I care about you, Lenny,
a lot more than you know,

1296
01:49:38.930 --> 01:49:42.058
which makes us both
pretty stupid, huh?

1297
01:49:42.100 --> 01:49:45.854
But if you pawn this tape...

1298
01:49:45.895 --> 01:49:48.732
you mean nothing to me.

1299
01:50:03.039 --> 01:50:04.499
Excuse me.

1300
01:50:05.709 --> 01:50:07.794
Excuse me.

1301
01:50:15.511 --> 01:50:17.639
You see that guy over there?

1302
01:50:17.681 --> 01:50:21.351
<i>That's Deputy Commissioner
Palmer Strickland,</i>

1303
01:50:21.393 --> 01:50:23.479
the prick who busted me out.

1304
01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:26.523
His ass is so tight,
only dogs hear his farts.

1305
01:50:26.565 --> 01:50:29.193
<i>If there's a clean cop, it's him.</i>

1306
01:50:29.234 --> 01:50:32.362
- Take it to him.
- You want me to trust a cop?

1307
01:50:32.404 --> 01:50:35.324
No. Trust me. Here.

1308
01:50:40.581 --> 01:50:42.666
What if you're wrong?

1309
01:50:46.962 --> 01:50:48.672
Go.

1310
01:50:57.139 --> 01:50:58.600
Excuse me.

1311
01:51:20.249 --> 01:51:22.000
Commissioner...

1312
01:51:22.042 --> 01:51:26.338
<i>there's a clip in here
that you need to see right now.</i>

1313
01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:28.466
<i>If it weren't New Year's Eve,</i>

1314
01:51:28.508 --> 01:51:32.011
<i>I'd have you arrested for possession
of illegal equipment.</i>

1315
01:51:32.053 --> 01:51:34.514
You wanna know who killed Jeriko,

1316
01:51:34.556 --> 01:51:36.808
you go into that stall
and hit "play."

1317
01:51:36.850 --> 01:51:39.353
Sir, is there a problem here?

1318
01:51:40.396 --> 01:51:42.898
<i>- Damn it, I knew it.
- Come on, let's go.</i>

1319
01:51:42.940 --> 01:51:45.025
- Let go of me!
- Sir?

1320
01:51:52.158 --> 01:51:55.662
Wade, can we talk here
like two human beings?

1321
01:52:00.001 --> 01:52:01.878
<i>It's nothing personal.</i>

1322
01:52:06.174 --> 01:52:08.259
Remember me, you fucking bitch?

1323
01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:11.888
Come on! Come on!

1324
01:52:22.317 --> 01:52:24.736
What are you looking at?

1325
01:52:28.448 --> 01:52:30.033
God damn it!

1326
01:52:33.620 --> 01:52:35.538
Enjoy the party.

1327
01:53:01.734 --> 01:53:03.820
Steckler... Steckler!

1328
01:54:42.927 --> 01:54:44.386
Fuck!

1329
01:54:51.187 --> 01:54:53.272
<i>I didn't hear you come in.</i>

1330
01:54:56.526 --> 01:54:57.985
Ah!

1331
01:55:14.129 --> 01:55:15.588
No!

1332
01:55:33.941 --> 01:55:35.943
No... no!

1333
01:56:24.913 --> 01:56:26.789
Shit.

1334
01:57:57.556 --> 01:57:58.932
OK?

1335
01:58:03.187 --> 01:58:05.689
Did I hurt you?

1336
01:58:05.731 --> 01:58:07.316
Huh?

1337
01:58:07.357 --> 01:58:09.527
I love you, Max.

1338
01:58:12.990 --> 01:58:15.034
You're so pretty, Faith.

1339
01:58:15.075 --> 01:58:16.535
Shit!

1340
01:58:16.577 --> 01:58:21.916
<i>- Come here, you fucker...
- You want to fuckin' die?</i>

1341
01:58:21.957 --> 01:58:24.877
<i>You want to fuckin' die?</i>

1342
01:58:24.919 --> 01:58:28.172
This piece of puke hired me
to kill you. Can you believe that?

1343
01:58:28.214 --> 01:58:31.342
<i>- Ain't that right?
- I can't believe this is happening.</i>

1344
01:58:31.383 --> 01:58:33.262
Believe it!

1345
01:58:33.304 --> 01:58:35.848
Bring me the 'trodes
and the deck. Qçuick!

1346
01:58:35.890 --> 01:58:39.852
Come here, big shot, suck on this.
You wanna suck on something?

1347
01:58:39.894 --> 01:58:43.356
<i>What are you gonna do?
You can't just kill him, Max!</i>

1348
01:58:43.397 --> 01:58:47.026
<i>I'm not going to. Give me that.
Just a little poach job.</i>

1349
01:58:48.402 --> 01:58:50.905
You shut the fuck up!

1350
01:58:50.947 --> 01:58:53.992
Shut up or I'll pull
this fucking trigger!

1351
01:58:54.034 --> 01:58:56.411
Fuck!

1352
01:58:58.289 --> 01:59:02.126
<i>- Here's how much I love you, baby.
- God, Max!</i>

1353
01:59:02.168 --> 01:59:04.838
Hope you enjoy the show, Philo...

1354
01:59:05.713 --> 01:59:07.799
you fuck.

1355
01:59:09.676 --> 01:59:13.805
<i>- Take it, you prick!
- No, Max, don't! Don't do it!</i>

1356
01:59:15.057 --> 01:59:17.852
Take it! Take it!

1357
01:59:17.893 --> 01:59:19.353
Take it!

1358
01:59:34.744 --> 01:59:38.708
<i>Don't make any assumptions
about our friendship, OK, Lenny?</i>

1359
01:59:48.510 --> 01:59:51.346
<i>I didn't know you
were colour blind, Max.</i>

1360
01:59:51.388 --> 01:59:54.057
Only way I could stand your ties.

1361
01:59:54.099 --> 01:59:56.186
Manos arriba, amigo.

1362
01:59:58.688 --> 01:59:59.898
Ooh.

1363
02:00:00.690 --> 02:00:02.984
Glock. 23.

1364
02:00:03.026 --> 02:00:04.694
Nice.

1365
02:00:05.236 --> 02:00:08.490
<i>- Where's Faith?
- I sent her to the party.</i>

1366
02:00:08.531 --> 02:00:12.828
- I'll wait here until you kill Gant.
- What makes you think I will?

1367
02:00:13.537 --> 02:00:15.331
You just did.

1368
02:00:15.372 --> 02:00:16.958
Jesus!

1369
02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:20.128
<i>You know, that's the second most
common word people say</i>

1370
02:00:20.170 --> 02:00:23.965
right before they die...
"shit" being number one.

1371
02:00:24.007 --> 02:00:30.263
So... I killed Gant, then you ran in,
being on his payroll... and shot me.

1372
02:00:30.305 --> 02:00:32.641
<i>That's just about the way
it happened.</i>

1373
02:00:32.682 --> 02:00:35.101
<i>Wait. I killed Iris, too, didn't I?</i>

1374
02:00:35.143 --> 02:00:38.815
They'll find the original
of her snuff clip in your apartment.

1375
02:00:38.857 --> 02:00:41.443
The one I left at the club
was a copy.

1376
02:00:41.485 --> 02:00:44.446
Was I a busy guy? Did I do Tick, too?

1377
02:00:44.488 --> 02:00:47.157
- Oh, you bet. Did you like it?
- So, why, Max?

1378
02:00:48.826 --> 02:00:51.787
- Why did you have to do Iris?
- Oh, picture it.

1379
02:00:51.829 --> 02:00:55.290
<i>I got to share this with somebody
cos it's just too perfect, OK?</i>

1380
02:00:55.332 --> 02:00:58.670
<i>- I won't say anything.
- Oh, I know.</i>

1381
02:00:59.420 --> 02:01:04.593
<i>I'm working for this puke who says
he'll pay me large to do the hooker.</i>

1382
02:01:04.635 --> 02:01:06.720
I also got to do his girlfriend

1383
02:01:06.762 --> 02:01:09.306
<i>cos she knows the score
and she's out of control.</i>

1384
02:01:09.348 --> 02:01:12.017
<i>Only he doesn't know about
me and Faith.</i>

1385
02:01:12.059 --> 02:01:15.604
So I say to myself,
"If I turn the job down,

1386
02:01:15.646 --> 02:01:19.985
"he'll get somebody else,
and I lose Faith," to coin a phrase.

1387
02:01:20.026 --> 02:01:24.614
So to buy time, I do the skank,
but I still got to deal with Gant.

1388
02:01:24.656 --> 02:01:29.745
<i>It's him or me, but I can't cap him
without some chump to take the fall.</i>

1389
02:01:30.163 --> 02:01:34.709
<i>And who better than his girlfriend's
loser ex-boyfriend...</i>

1390
02:01:34.750 --> 02:01:38.129
<i>known criminal and who's been seen
hassling him in public?</i>

1391
02:01:38.171 --> 02:01:42.759
Who is, regrettably, also
your best fucking friend.

1392
02:01:42.801 --> 02:01:44.720
No plan is perfect, Lenny.

1393
02:01:45.554 --> 02:01:48.390
<i>Cheer up, the world's gonna end
in ten minutes.</i>

1394
02:01:48.432 --> 02:01:50.517
You must be so pleased.

1395
02:01:50.559 --> 02:01:54.272
I mean, I followed
your jelly bean trail right here,

1396
02:01:54.314 --> 02:01:56.191
like a good little chump.

1397
02:01:56.232 --> 02:01:58.902
- You got foggy on me a couple times.
- Oh?

1398
02:01:58.943 --> 02:02:02.531
Remember the death squad? I had to
keep you from going to the cops.

1399
02:02:02.573 --> 02:02:05.409
I've heard stuff
about a death squad.

1400
02:02:05.451 --> 02:02:10.456
<i>It's not about if you're paranoid.
It's whether you're paranoid enough.</i>

1401
02:02:10.498 --> 02:02:13.000
- So there never was a death squad.
- No.

1402
02:02:13.042 --> 02:02:16.253
Just two loose cops running round
covering their butts.

1403
02:02:16.295 --> 02:02:20.675
Zany, huh? All this shit
caused by a random traffic stop.

1404
02:02:20.717 --> 02:02:23.513
Nothing means nothing, man.
You know that.

1405
02:02:23.554 --> 02:02:25.973
<i>Look around.
The planet's in fucking chaos.</i>

1406
02:02:26.015 --> 02:02:28.768
The day of reckoning is upon us!

1407
02:02:28.809 --> 02:02:31.312
Get what you can while you can

1408
02:02:31.354 --> 02:02:36.275
cos some shit can put a. 22 in
the back of your head... any second.

1409
02:02:39.403 --> 02:02:41.949
<i>How'd you hook up with Faith?</i>

1410
02:02:41.990 --> 02:02:44.077
Hmm...

1411
02:02:44.410 --> 02:02:48.498
This fuck hires me about a month ago
to eyeball her, only...

1412
02:02:48.540 --> 02:02:50.625
Faith knows me from you.

1413
02:02:50.667 --> 02:02:54.295
She comes up and says,
"Max, why are you following me?"

1414
02:02:54.337 --> 02:02:58.216
And I say, "I'll buy you a drink.
I'll explain."

1415
02:02:58.258 --> 02:03:00.426
And she says...

1416
02:03:00.468 --> 02:03:02.554
Do you enjoy watching me?

1417
02:03:04.265 --> 02:03:06.976
You're supposed to go
downstairs, baby.

1418
02:03:07.017 --> 02:03:11.356
<i>I know. I don't always do
what I'm told, Max, you know that.</i>

1419
02:03:11.398 --> 02:03:14.526
So I said, "Do you enjoy
watching me?"

1420
02:03:14.568 --> 02:03:16.695
Come on, Max. Play with me.

1421
02:03:16.736 --> 02:03:18.905
And then what did you say?

1422
02:03:18.947 --> 02:03:21.992
<i>I said I'd even do it for free.</i>

1423
02:03:22.033 --> 02:03:23.411
Uh-huh.

1424
02:03:23.452 --> 02:03:27.915
<i>I said, "That's good, because I like
the feeling of someone watching me. "</i>

1425
02:03:27.957 --> 02:03:30.168
I acquired the taste from Lenny.

1426
02:03:30.209 --> 02:03:35.799
Then she said, "Since we're gonna be
spending so much time together..."

1427
02:03:35.841 --> 02:03:38.760
<i>"Why don't we make the best of it?"</i>

1428
02:03:48.354 --> 02:03:50.440
The very best.

1429
02:03:51.733 --> 02:03:55.069
<i>You know all about that,
don't you, Lenny?</i>

1430
02:03:55.111 --> 02:03:59.658
Faith and me, we found a place
that you could never reach, Max.

1431
02:03:59.700 --> 02:04:01.160
Never.

1432
02:04:02.077 --> 02:04:05.624
<i>Faith... I know it's gone...</i>

1433
02:04:07.375 --> 02:04:10.879
<i>but you, Max,
you can't fucking touch it.</i>

1434
02:04:11.338 --> 02:04:13.423
Enjoy it.

1435
02:04:13.882 --> 02:04:15.634
Lenny!

1436
02:04:50.422 --> 02:04:53.217
Get off, you fucking bitch!

1437
02:05:13.531 --> 02:05:14.740
God!

1438
02:05:32.968 --> 02:05:34.970
Fuck you!

1439
02:06:02.791 --> 02:06:05.420
What the fuck are you doing?

1440
02:06:06.546 --> 02:06:08.632
You're coming with me!

1441
02:06:19.477 --> 02:06:20.937
Ohh!

1442
02:06:30.532 --> 02:06:32.617
Come here. Come here, Lenny!

1443
02:06:32.659 --> 02:06:36.204
<i>I'm taking you with me,
you motherfucker! Come here!</i>

1444
02:06:36.246 --> 02:06:39.082
Come here! You fuck!

1445
02:06:43.044 --> 02:06:44.671
Come here!

1446
02:07:26.550 --> 02:07:29.219
# They're selling Jesus again
they want your soul

1447
02:07:30.345 --> 02:07:33.892
# And your money, your blood,
and your votes

1448
02:07:33.933 --> 02:07:36.728
# They're selling Jesus again

1449
02:07:36.769 --> 02:07:39.814
# Selling love to you

1450
02:07:39.856 --> 02:07:44.570
# They're selling love, love

1451
02:07:45.279 --> 02:07:48.741
# Love... #

1452
02:07:48.949 --> 02:07:51.035
There she is!

1453
02:09:10.496 --> 02:09:12.290
Freeze!

1454
02:09:12.832 --> 02:09:14.917
I said, fucking freeze!

1455
02:09:29.642 --> 02:09:32.270
Down! All the way down! Right now!

1456
02:09:33.313 --> 02:09:35.398
Now pay attention, motherfucker!

1457
02:09:36.817 --> 02:09:38.903
Stay down.

1458
02:09:50.415 --> 02:09:52.584
Down! Down! Down! Down!

1459
02:09:57.924 --> 02:10:01.552
<i>Down now! You son of a bitch!
You ain't goin' anywhere!</i>

1460
02:10:01.594 --> 02:10:04.430
Shut up and move!
Get back! In a circle!

1461
02:10:10.811 --> 02:10:12.856
Break this circle!

1462
02:10:16.276 --> 02:10:18.321
Put that gun down!

1463
02:10:18.363 --> 02:10:22.158
- Get on the ground now!
- Hold on. Hold on.

1464
02:10:22.784 --> 02:10:26.579
<i>I'll tell you what's going on here.
Let me tell you what's going on.</i>

1465
02:10:26.621 --> 02:10:29.832
Get on the ground now! Get down!

1466
02:10:29.874 --> 02:10:32.252
Let me tell you what happened,
all right?

1467
02:10:32.293 --> 02:10:34.796
Get on the ground now!

1468
02:10:35.380 --> 02:10:37.465
All right?

1469
02:10:43.306 --> 02:10:45.350
Get these fucking things off me!

1470
02:10:45.392 --> 02:10:49.104
<i>- No! Don't uncuff him!
- Shut up! Get down!</i>

1471
02:10:51.523 --> 02:10:55.026
<i>Wait!
You don't know what happened!</i>

1472
02:10:55.068 --> 02:10:57.237
Fuck her up!

1473
02:11:06.331 --> 02:11:08.417
Hit her! Hit her!

1474
02:11:09.543 --> 02:11:11.837
Leave her alone!

1475
02:12:45.022 --> 02:12:47.108
Commissioner Strickland!

1476
02:12:47.149 --> 02:12:50.152
That is the cause of all this!

1477
02:12:50.945 --> 02:12:53.155
Right fucking there!

1478
02:13:02.415 --> 02:13:05.252
These two are under arrest
for murder!

1479
02:13:06.670 --> 02:13:09.132
Read them their rights! Move it!

1480
02:13:09.173 --> 02:13:10.758
Yes, sir.

1481
02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:13.177
You have the right to remain silent.

1482
02:13:13.219 --> 02:13:16.306
Anything you say can and will
be used against you.

1483
02:13:16.347 --> 02:13:21.102
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney...

1484
02:13:21.144 --> 02:13:24.565
Get this woman
some medical attention.

1485
02:13:24.607 --> 02:13:26.901
Get some medical attention!

1486
02:13:30.362 --> 02:13:32.448
Mace, are you OK?

1487
02:13:32.489 --> 02:13:34.826
I got 'em.

1488
02:13:47.590 --> 02:13:50.384
Get the fuck outta here! Everybody!

1489
02:13:50.426 --> 02:13:52.511
Back the fuck up!

1490
02:13:52.553 --> 02:13:54.555
Drop your weapon!

1491
02:13:54.597 --> 02:13:56.766
Drop it now!

1492
02:13:57.976 --> 02:13:59.937
No! NO!

1493
02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:03.565
NO!

1494
02:14:22.126 --> 02:14:25.130
Put that gun down!

1495
02:14:25.172 --> 02:14:27.759
- Drop your weapon!
- Drop the gun now!

1496
02:14:27.801 --> 02:14:30.470
Now! Drop it!

1497
02:14:33.723 --> 02:14:36.309
- Put it down right now!
- Drop your weapon!

1498
02:14:36.351 --> 02:14:38.436
Shoot!

1499
02:14:38.478 --> 02:14:41.273
You fucking... nigger bitch!

1500
02:15:01.795 --> 02:15:02.838
Lenny!

1501
02:15:03.463 --> 02:15:04.756
Lenny!

1502
02:15:04.798 --> 02:15:09.137
Lenny! Lenny!
No, no, Lenny, Lenny...

1503
02:15:09.178 --> 02:15:11.389
Lenny! Lenny!

1504
02:15:14.351 --> 02:15:16.186
Yeah?

1505
02:15:16.228 --> 02:15:17.438
What?

1506
02:15:32.787 --> 02:15:34.873
Are we under arrest?

1507
02:15:34.915 --> 02:15:38.377
Nah, they just have to ask us
a few questions...

1508
02:15:38.419 --> 02:15:40.504
for about six hours.

1509
02:15:47.345 --> 02:15:49.932
OK, where are you hurt, sir?

1510
02:15:49.973 --> 02:15:52.684
Ma'am, you OK? Ma'am?

1511
02:15:52.726 --> 02:15:54.019
Yeah.

1512
02:15:54.061 --> 02:15:57.773
We need to get that coat off you.
Hurt anywhere else?

1513
02:15:57.814 --> 02:16:00.317
Ten! Nine!

1514
02:16:00.359 --> 02:16:03.112
Eight! Seven!

Two! One!

1518
02:16:39.986 --> 02:16:42.655
<i>You need an ambulance, sir.
Let's go this way.</i>

1519
02:16:42.697 --> 02:16:44.865
Go out this way, sir.

1520
02:16:45.950 --> 02:16:48.369
Hey, Lenny. We made it.

1521
02:16:52.749 --> 02:16:54.836
Yeah, we did.

1522
02:17:01.134 --> 02:17:03.219
You should get going.

1523
02:17:04.512 --> 02:17:07.473
Yeah. See you downtown.

1524
02:17:07.515 --> 02:17:09.601
See you there.

1525
02:17:11.060 --> 02:17:13.147
Make way.

1526
02:17:23.700 --> 02:17:27.287
# Ah

1527
02:17:30.916 --> 02:17:33.002
# Ah

1528
02:17:34.921 --> 02:17:37.048
# Ah

1529
02:17:41.552 --> 02:17:45.307
# Ah

1530
02:17:55.401 --> 02:17:59.405
# Ah

1531
02:18:04.535 --> 02:18:07.580
<i># It's in this moment</i>

1532
02:18:07.622 --> 02:18:11.168
# Hold on

1533
02:18:11.210 --> 02:18:14.255
# When everything has come apart

1534
02:18:17.509 --> 02:18:20.095
<i># It's in this moment</i>

1535
02:18:20.136 --> 02:18:22.639
# Right now

1536
02:18:22.681 --> 02:18:25.725
# We can go together

1537
02:18:29.312 --> 02:18:34.527
# Raise your sights

1538
02:18:35.404 --> 02:18:39.241
<i># What's there to lose?</i>

1539
02:18:42.035 --> 02:18:44.538
# Fall in the light

1540
02:18:44.830 --> 02:18:47.541
# Fall in the light

1541
02:18:47.791 --> 02:18:53.171
# Fall in the light

1542
02:18:54.006 --> 02:18:59.680
# Will you catch me?

1543
02:18:59.722 --> 02:19:03.517
# Hold on, hold on, hold on

1544
02:19:06.186 --> 02:19:08.063
# I know you'll catch me #
