00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:29.228
Crimson and clover

2
00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:32.106
Over and over

3
00:00:32.606 --> 00:00:35.401
Crimson and clover...

4
00:00:36.861 --> 00:00:38.137
...believe your eyes...

5
00:00:38.137 --> 00:00:41.682
those are the northern lights
on view above the city...

6
00:00:41.682 --> 00:00:44.894
for the first time in nearly eighty years.

7
00:00:44.894 --> 00:00:48.205
Oh, Susie Q, baby, l love you...

8
00:00:49.707 --> 00:00:51.317
lt's 5.00 a.m.
Hello, New York.

9
00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:54.195
The big story this morning
is the Amazings...

10
00:00:54.195 --> 00:00:56.238
taking the field today in Baltimore...

11
00:00:56.238 --> 00:00:58.407
for their final practise
before tomorrow's opener...

12
00:00:58.407 --> 00:01:00.593
of the 1969 World--

13
00:01:01.093 --> 00:01:02.745
Early this morning,
sanitation workers...

14
00:01:02.745 --> 00:01:04.664
discovered the dead body
of another nurse...

15
00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:06.332
in a Dumpster in Queens.

16
00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:08.793
This is the third nurse killed
in what New York papers...

17
00:01:08.793 --> 00:01:12.313
are now calling the Nightingale murders.

18
00:01:18.194 --> 00:01:20.263
All three victims have been nurses...

19
00:01:20.263 --> 00:01:21.847
each of them found strangled...

20
00:01:21.847 --> 00:01:24.225
with their hands gruesomely
bound behind their backs...

21
00:01:24.225 --> 00:01:26.325
with glass tape.

22
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.188
The lights, also known
as the aurora borealis--

23
00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:31.288
Look out.

24
00:01:44.595 --> 00:01:46.664
Manhattan calling Eye of the Storm.

25
00:01:46.664 --> 00:01:49.583
Engine company one-two,
ladder company nine-three...

26
00:01:49.583 --> 00:01:51.127
respond to Manhattan box...

27
00:01:51.127 --> 00:01:55.089
one-three-two off-ramp
on George Washington Bridge.

28
00:01:55.089 --> 00:01:57.189
On our way.

29
00:02:01.237 --> 00:02:04.348
Frank, we're the second in.
We got the rescue.

30
00:02:04.348 --> 00:02:05.068
Great.

31
00:02:34.603 --> 00:02:36.255
Commander,
what do you need done?

32
00:02:36.255 --> 00:02:37.965
That dike's about to go.

33
00:02:37.965 --> 00:02:39.592
We're one spark away
from losing the block.

34
00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:40.843
ls there another way in?

35
00:02:40.843 --> 00:02:43.179
Only that manhole leads to the vault.

36
00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:44.764
Forget it, Sullivan.

37
00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:48.643
Vault door's rusted shut,
and they can't kill the juice.

38
00:02:48.643 --> 00:02:51.562
Frank, you're not going to make it.
There's not enough time.

39
00:02:51.562 --> 00:02:53.397
What, miss the World Series?

40
00:02:53.397 --> 00:02:56.047
Not a chance.
Give me my tools.

41
00:03:00.004 --> 00:03:02.949
Sullivan,
this is Commander O'Connell.

42
00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:04.241
Can you hear me?

43
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:05.576
l hear you, Commander.

44
00:03:05.576 --> 00:03:07.620
The gasoline is rising in the vault.

45
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.540
Those downed cables
hit that gas, it's going to blow.

46
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.750
Way to go, Gib.

47
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.995
l should have been a goddamn mailman.

48
00:03:18.606 --> 00:03:21.921
Clear this channel.
Explosion's imminent.

49
00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.766
Guys. Can you hear me?

50
00:03:28.766 --> 00:03:30.991
We're in here.
- Coming in.

51
00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:34.038
Get us out.
- He's got a broken leg.

52
00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:40.314
Frank, it's going to flash.
Get out of there.

53
00:03:40.628 --> 00:03:42.671
The dike isn't holding.

54
00:03:43.172 --> 00:03:44.323
Get us out.

55
00:03:44.323 --> 00:03:46.033
Frank, did you hear me?

56
00:03:46.033 --> 00:03:48.683
l hear you, Butch.
Grab that axe.

57
00:03:48.683 --> 00:03:50.719
Here.

58
00:03:51.013 --> 00:03:54.100
Give me a whack. No sparks.
Again.

59
00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:58.771
One more.
OK, stand back.

60
00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.239
Thank God.

61
00:04:10.574 --> 00:04:13.119
My leg's all busted up.

62
00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:15.830
Please hurry.

63
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.330
We're in, Butch.

64
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.443
Get them and get the hell out.

65
00:04:20.443 --> 00:04:22.923
Hey, fellas.
Time to go home.

66
00:04:23.337 --> 00:04:25.337
Watch it. Watch it.

67
00:04:26.841 --> 00:04:28.409
lt's falling.
lt's going to break.

68
00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:31.994
Let's go. That's an order.
Everybody goes.

69
00:04:35.015 --> 00:04:38.669
All right. Let's move
before the gas lights up.

70
00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.769
Watch that wire.

71
00:04:42.231 --> 00:04:44.050
Get out, for Christ's sake.

72
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.150
l got you.

73
00:04:50.322 --> 00:04:53.492
Butch,
we're coming out right now.

74
00:04:53.993 --> 00:04:54.743
Go.

75
00:04:55.494 --> 00:04:56.604
You all right?

76
00:04:56.604 --> 00:04:58.704
Watch your head.

77
00:05:00.291 --> 00:05:02.586
Get up that ladder.
Go ahead.

78
00:05:02.918 --> 00:05:04.918
Get up. Get up.

79
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.300
Go on up.

80
00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:14.288
Go. Right behind you.

81
00:05:14.288 --> 00:05:15.498
l am going.

82
00:05:15.498 --> 00:05:16.999
Pull him up.

83
00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:18.334
Come on.

84
00:05:18.334 --> 00:05:21.562
Come on. l got you.

85
00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:59.517
Welcome to the company, Gib.

86
00:06:46.647 --> 00:06:48.647
Hey, fellas?

87
00:06:52.903 --> 00:06:54.263
Hey, Dad.

88
00:06:54.263 --> 00:06:56.363
Hey. Hey, Gordo.

89
00:06:56.363 --> 00:06:58.532
Hey, Mr Sullivan.

90
00:06:58.532 --> 00:07:00.617
How you doing?

91
00:07:02.246 --> 00:07:04.398
How's my Little Chief?
- Good.

92
00:07:04.398 --> 00:07:07.728
Where's your mother?
- lnside the house.

93
00:07:16.635 --> 00:07:18.679
Hey, Jules.

94
00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:22.139
Hey, bud.
- Hey, bud.

95
00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:29.131
How about a little bit of the King?

96
00:07:29.131 --> 00:07:32.206
Yeah, why not a little of the King?

97
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:33.719
Damn.

98
00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:35.179
You all right?

99
00:07:35.179 --> 00:07:39.200
Yeah. l think l ruined the sauce...again.

100
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.018
What's the matter, bud?

101
00:07:41.018 --> 00:07:43.813
Trouble working an 8-hour shift
at the hospital...

102
00:07:43.813 --> 00:07:47.316
watching the kid,
whipping up a little Bolognese?

103
00:07:47.316 --> 00:07:48.943
You didn't marry Donna Reed.

104
00:07:48.943 --> 00:07:51.045
l'd go for you...

105
00:07:51.545 --> 00:07:54.690
and Chinese takeout over her any day.

106
00:07:54.690 --> 00:08:00.262
Because l love you too much,
baby

107
00:08:03.891 --> 00:08:05.891
Why can't you see

108
00:08:07.478 --> 00:08:09.046
What you're doing to me...

109
00:08:09.046 --> 00:08:11.132
How was your tour?
- The usual.

110
00:08:11.132 --> 00:08:12.842
Butch called.

111
00:08:12.842 --> 00:08:14.942
Did he?
- He did.

112
00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:17.888
lt was under control, bud.

113
00:08:17.888 --> 00:08:20.891
Butch, he's getting
a little tight in his old age.

114
00:08:20.891 --> 00:08:25.326
Nothing wrong with old age,
as long as you get there.

115
00:09:03.534 --> 00:09:04.894
All right, Chief.

116
00:09:04.894 --> 00:09:07.730
When l let go,
l want you to keep pedalling.

117
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.066
Put the wheels back on.
l am going to fall.

118
00:09:10.066 --> 00:09:13.361
Don't worry about falling.
You're ready to do this.

119
00:09:13.361 --> 00:09:15.841
Come on.
Spirit and guts, OK?

120
00:09:17.757 --> 00:09:20.217
All right.
Keep pedalling.

121
00:09:20.718 --> 00:09:23.098
l am going to let go. That's it.

122
00:09:23.098 --> 00:09:27.089
Keep pedalling. Keep pedalling.
Keep pedalling.

123
00:09:28.267 --> 00:09:29.627
You all right?

124
00:09:29.627 --> 00:09:31.727
Johnny?

125
00:09:32.646 --> 00:09:36.567
You OK? Are you hurt?
Are you OK? You OK?

126
00:09:37.068 --> 00:09:38.261
Go on, honey. lt's OK.

127
00:09:38.261 --> 00:09:41.013
Come on, Chief.
Don't quit on me now.

128
00:09:41.013 --> 00:09:44.598
Don't be so tough on him.
He's just a kid.

129
00:09:45.868 --> 00:09:49.268
He just needs to know you're behind him.

130
00:09:50.831 --> 00:09:54.794
OK. You're right. All right.

131
00:10:37.712 --> 00:10:40.798
CQ-22, this is W2QYV,
by for call.

132
00:10:41.298 --> 00:10:42.950
...because of the solar activity.

133
00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:44.160
lt's beautiful.

134
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.329
We got the sky lit up like a bonfire.

135
00:10:46.329 --> 00:10:48.623
Word is the sunspots
are shooting off flares...

136
00:10:48.623 --> 00:10:51.375
that stretch out half a million kilometres.

137
00:10:51.375 --> 00:10:52.835
Tell me about it.

138
00:10:52.835 --> 00:10:55.588
l am picking up signals
l could never reach before.

139
00:10:55.588 --> 00:10:58.257
Francis, is that you?
How are you doing, my friend?

140
00:10:58.257 --> 00:10:59.884
l am doing great.
How you doing?

141
00:10:59.884 --> 00:11:01.177
Fantastic.

142
00:11:01.177 --> 00:11:05.102
My wife, Sophia,
she's giving me another baby.

143
00:11:39.023 --> 00:11:41.509
So, that's it, Samantha?
You're just walking out?

144
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:43.594
l have been walking out for six months, John.

145
00:11:43.594 --> 00:11:46.329
You just didn't notice or care.

146
00:11:51.452 --> 00:11:55.277
You're right.
We should have quit a long time ago.

147
00:11:59.335 --> 00:12:02.171
l am sorry.
l know it's my fault.

148
00:12:02.671 --> 00:12:06.409
l can't change, Sam.
l wish l could, but l can't.

149
00:12:06.409 --> 00:12:10.012
No, John,
it's that you won't change.

150
00:12:12.223 --> 00:12:14.773
And that's what hurts so much.

151
00:12:16.644 --> 00:12:18.644
Goodbye, Chief.

152
00:13:14.994 --> 00:13:18.289
Next up, Johnny Sullivan.

153
00:13:23.044 --> 00:13:25.084
lt's a hit up the middle.

154
00:13:28.424 --> 00:13:31.144
And Johnny's going to hold at first.

155
00:13:31.677 --> 00:13:36.599
Now batting for Johnny's father,
Coach Newman.

156
00:13:44.023 --> 00:13:46.609
He checks the runner and fires.

157
00:13:47.109 --> 00:13:49.109
Lined hard to right.

158
00:13:49.445 --> 00:13:51.740
No problem.
One on. One out.

159
00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.350
Hi, Uncle John.
- l am not your uncle, kid.

160
00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:56.102
Hey, Sully. ls that you?

161
00:13:56.102 --> 00:13:58.771
Gordo, what are you guys
doing in my house?

162
00:13:58.771 --> 00:14:00.871
My TV's out again.

163
00:14:01.332 --> 00:14:04.710
Hey, you want a brewski?

164
00:14:07.963 --> 00:14:11.450
Do you believe Linda still
won't let me cook in the house?

165
00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.953
l melt one lousy frying pan,
you know?

166
00:14:13.953 --> 00:14:16.205
John, guess what?
Dad's taking me fishing.

167
00:14:16.205 --> 00:14:19.083
want to come?
- l wish l could, Gordy.

168
00:14:19.083 --> 00:14:21.794
But you bring me back a big one, OK?

169
00:14:21.794 --> 00:14:24.088
ls it OK if Gordy uses your old gear?

170
00:14:24.088 --> 00:14:26.215
l think it's somewhere in the hall closet...

171
00:14:26.215 --> 00:14:27.550
if you can find it.

172
00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:29.650
Gordy, have a look.

173
00:14:30.778 --> 00:14:33.598
Yahoo went up another five points today.

174
00:14:33.598 --> 00:14:36.017
Did l miss the boat on that one.

175
00:14:36.017 --> 00:14:38.582
Should have, would have, could have, pal.

176
00:14:38.786 --> 00:14:41.247
So Sam called Linda.

177
00:14:41.747 --> 00:14:44.041
Dad, John, come here.

178
00:14:44.542 --> 00:14:47.069
Gordy, what are you doing back there?

179
00:14:47.069 --> 00:14:49.169
Dad, check it out.

180
00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:52.466
Fire department.
Can l open it up?

181
00:14:52.967 --> 00:14:54.967
Sure.

182
00:15:03.102 --> 00:15:05.755
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Give me that gun.

183
00:15:05.755 --> 00:15:07.855
All right?

184
00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:10.274
What's this, Dad?

185
00:15:10.693 --> 00:15:12.693
Oh, my God.

186
00:15:12.693 --> 00:15:15.698
John,
it's your dad's old ham radio.

187
00:15:16.198 --> 00:15:20.561
Remember how we used to beg him
to let us talk on this thing?

188
00:15:20.561 --> 00:15:23.230
This...is not a toy.
- ls not a toy.

189
00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:24.982
Can we try it, Dad?

190
00:15:24.982 --> 00:15:26.233
Ask Uncle John.

191
00:15:26.233 --> 00:15:27.985
Can we try it?

192
00:15:27.985 --> 00:15:29.320
What the hell.

193
00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.657
All right. Here.
Let's grab this baby out.

194
00:15:32.657 --> 00:15:36.385
This is what we used when l was your age.

195
00:15:36.886 --> 00:15:40.748
Let's go over to the den.
Plug it in, like the old times.

196
00:15:40.748 --> 00:15:42.848
We want CW or LSB.

197
00:15:42.848 --> 00:15:46.395
Stand by function.
Operator. Come on.

198
00:15:46.896 --> 00:15:48.506
l don't know what's going on.

199
00:15:48.506 --> 00:15:51.326
Let's take a look under the hood.

200
00:15:51.692 --> 00:15:53.692
See what we got here.

201
00:15:54.987 --> 00:15:56.987
Check this baby out.

202
00:15:56.987 --> 00:15:58.724
There she is.

203
00:15:58.724 --> 00:16:01.143
This is what people used before the Net?

204
00:16:01.143 --> 00:16:02.353
Not exactly.

205
00:16:02.353 --> 00:16:05.106
l will tell you.
Hams were--Ah, bingo.

206
00:16:05.106 --> 00:16:06.983
These babies were different.

207
00:16:06.983 --> 00:16:08.526
Not everybody had one of these...

208
00:16:08.526 --> 00:16:12.697
and you needed a special licence
just to be able to talk on them.

209
00:16:12.697 --> 00:16:14.365
Damn. l just----

210
00:16:14.365 --> 00:16:16.284
l don't think it's going to work.

211
00:16:16.284 --> 00:16:17.493
lt's junk, kid.

212
00:16:17.493 --> 00:16:19.996
Nobody uses those things anymore.

213
00:16:19.996 --> 00:16:22.901
Gordo,
do you know what time it is?

214
00:16:22.901 --> 00:16:24.292
Hey, John.
- Hi, Linda.

215
00:16:24.292 --> 00:16:26.517
Come on, Gordy. Let's go.

216
00:16:27.478 --> 00:16:30.368
l will catch you later,
if l am lucky.

217
00:16:43.786 --> 00:16:45.813
Hi. This is Julia Sullivan.

218
00:16:45.813 --> 00:16:49.058
Please leave a message after the tone.

219
00:16:49.058 --> 00:16:51.125
Hey, Ma. lt's me.

220
00:16:51.125 --> 00:16:53.252
Just checking in.

221
00:16:53.546 --> 00:16:55.546
You're probably at work.

222
00:16:55.756 --> 00:17:00.428
Anyways,
l will see you tomorrow night.

223
00:17:01.554 --> 00:17:03.554
Love you.

224
00:17:16.152 --> 00:17:19.430
The aurora borealis,
to anyone who's seen it.....

225
00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:23.059
is one of the stunning events
of your lifetime.

226
00:17:23.059 --> 00:17:26.145
They're brighter these days.
ls something going on there?

227
00:17:26.145 --> 00:17:28.814
Do they tie in with your field?
Where do they come from?

228
00:17:28.814 --> 00:17:31.442
lt's truly a stunning sight.
lt's beautiful to look at.

229
00:17:31.442 --> 00:17:34.987
l don't think we have seen one
this bright for thirty years.

230
00:17:34.987 --> 00:17:38.449
From the point of view
of physics and string theory...

231
00:17:38.449 --> 00:17:40.117
there's nothing really that we gain...

232
00:17:40.117 --> 00:17:41.953
from studying the aurora borealis.

233
00:17:41.953 --> 00:17:43.704
History does teach us.....

234
00:17:43.704 --> 00:17:45.915
that every time we thought
we had it figured out...

235
00:17:45.915 --> 00:17:48.709
there was some major discovery
right around the bend...

236
00:17:48.709 --> 00:17:51.045
that required complete dramatic change...

237
00:17:51.045 --> 00:17:52.838
in our understanding
of the laws of physics.

238
00:17:52.838 --> 00:17:56.300
This is a phrase people have
begun to hear, string theory.

239
00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.219
Yes, that's right.

240
00:17:58.219 --> 00:18:00.805
String theory dramatically
changes our understanding...

241
00:18:00.805 --> 00:18:02.515
of space and time.

242
00:18:02.515 --> 00:18:04.684
For example, it turns out that string theory...

243
00:18:04.684 --> 00:18:08.437
requires our universe to have 10
or possibly even 11 dimensions.

244
00:18:08.437 --> 00:18:09.772
The strange thing is.....

245
00:18:09.772 --> 00:18:11.482
some physicists
are even pursuing the idea.....

246
00:18:11.482 --> 00:18:13.734
that there might be more
than one time dimension.

247
00:18:13.734 --> 00:18:16.404
So in addition to time as we
know it, psychological time...

248
00:18:16.404 --> 00:18:19.740
which seems to organize events
in the universe around us...

249
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.367
there may be a second time dimension...

250
00:18:21.367 --> 00:18:24.537
where the universe evolves
in some different manner.

251
00:18:24.537 --> 00:18:26.455
Another phrase...

252
00:18:26.455 --> 00:18:29.558
CQ-15. Come in, 15.

253
00:18:34.063 --> 00:18:38.025
W2QYV here. Who have l got?

254
00:18:38.526 --> 00:18:40.569
Name's John.

255
00:18:42.905 --> 00:18:45.016
You licensed to broadcast,
buddy?

256
00:18:45.016 --> 00:18:49.954
Look. l really don't remember
how this thing works.

257
00:18:50.454 --> 00:18:53.482
Listen. You can't broadcast
without a licence.

258
00:18:53.482 --> 00:18:56.861
Unless this is an emergency,
you have to get off the band.

259
00:18:56.861 --> 00:19:00.191
Hey, pal,
my whole life's an emergency.

260
00:19:00.548 --> 00:19:02.883
Where you transmitting from?

261
00:19:03.384 --> 00:19:05.384
Queens, New York.

262
00:19:05.594 --> 00:19:09.164
What do you know?
Bayside, born and raised.

263
00:19:09.164 --> 00:19:10.291
No kidding?

264
00:19:10.291 --> 00:19:12.960
l thought these things were
for talking around the world.

265
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.962
The 15 band closes down at night...

266
00:19:14.962 --> 00:19:16.339
but during the day...

267
00:19:16.339 --> 00:19:19.800
you can chew the band with China
if you want.

268
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.428
l can't believe people
are still using these things.

269
00:19:22.428 --> 00:19:24.513
You must be a real old-timer.

270
00:19:24.513 --> 00:19:28.059
Days like this, l feel like
l am getting there, you know?

271
00:19:28.059 --> 00:19:31.103
So, Queens,
you psyched for the series?

272
00:19:31.103 --> 00:19:35.283
You know, l really don't
follow baseball anymore.

273
00:19:35.541 --> 00:19:37.318
What?

274
00:19:37.318 --> 00:19:39.320
l got fed up with all the bullshit.

275
00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.322
What are you talking about?

276
00:19:41.322 --> 00:19:43.574
Let me tell you something.
A thousand years from now...

277
00:19:43.574 --> 00:19:45.576
when school kids study about America...

278
00:19:45.576 --> 00:19:47.578
they're going to learn about three things.

279
00:19:47.578 --> 00:19:51.766
The Constitution,
rock 'n' roll, and baseball.

280
00:19:53.267 --> 00:19:57.129
How can you live in Queens
and not love the Amazings?

281
00:19:57.129 --> 00:20:01.400
The Amazing Mets?
What, the '69 series?

282
00:20:01.901 --> 00:20:05.429
Man, l will love Ron Swoboda till the day l die.

283
00:20:05.429 --> 00:20:08.307
Now l am with you.
He's got the heart of a lion.

284
00:20:08.307 --> 00:20:10.476
Mets can't win game one without him.

285
00:20:10.476 --> 00:20:12.019
Can you hear me?

286
00:20:12.019 --> 00:20:14.522
Game one?
What are you talking about?

287
00:20:14.522 --> 00:20:16.065
lt was all over after Buford...

288
00:20:16.065 --> 00:20:19.610
nailed Seaver's second pitch
out of the park.

289
00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:22.154
No way, buddy.
Ain't going to happen.

290
00:20:22.154 --> 00:20:24.073
Hey, CQ-15.

291
00:20:24.073 --> 00:20:26.926
CQ-15, are you there?

292
00:20:30.346 --> 00:20:32.081
Who the hell was that?

293
00:20:32.081 --> 00:20:35.084
Queens, are you there, Queens?
Did l lose you?

294
00:20:35.084 --> 00:20:37.837
Hey, Frank.
Give the radio a rest.

295
00:20:37.837 --> 00:20:40.298
Your son wants to say good night.

296
00:20:40.298 --> 00:20:42.216
All right.
l will be right there.

297
00:20:42.216 --> 00:20:45.678
Would parallel universes
ever become aware of each other?

298
00:20:45.678 --> 00:20:47.888
Who knows?
lt's a strange idea...

299
00:20:47.888 --> 00:20:50.141
Elvis, you all right?
l am sorry.

300
00:20:50.141 --> 00:20:51.809
You OK, Frank?
- We're fine.

301
00:20:51.809 --> 00:20:53.561
You all right, buddy?

302
00:20:53.561 --> 00:20:55.996
You OK, buddy?

303
00:20:58.207 --> 00:21:00.151
The sunspots are going to
have a serious impact...

304
00:21:00.151 --> 00:21:03.863
on radio communications
for the next six or seven days.

305
00:21:03.863 --> 00:21:05.906
ln fact,
quantum theory tells us...

306
00:21:05.906 --> 00:21:08.826
that the rigid notions
of past, present and future...

307
00:21:08.826 --> 00:21:10.828
although useful in day-to-day life...

308
00:21:10.828 --> 00:21:14.040
may dissolve and be replaced
by a complex formulation...

309
00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.042
in which time is far more fluid...

310
00:21:16.042 --> 00:21:17.960
than anybody would have imagined.

311
00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.440
Take me out to the ball game

312
00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:26.610
Take me out with the crowd

313
00:21:27.111 --> 00:21:32.616
Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jacks...

314
00:21:33.117 --> 00:21:37.955
l don't care if l never get back...

315
00:21:38.456 --> 00:21:40.066
because it's root

316
00:21:40.066 --> 00:21:43.836
Root, root for the home team...

317
00:21:44.336 --> 00:21:46.589
lf we don't win

318
00:21:51.135 --> 00:21:53.600
Two, three strikes you're out

319
00:21:53.929 --> 00:21:57.679
....At the old ball game....

320
00:21:59.602 --> 00:22:01.602
That's perfect.

321
00:22:02.063 --> 00:22:03.965
Butch,
you got to turn the whole set.

322
00:22:03.965 --> 00:22:06.067
Can't wait till the game.

323
00:22:06.567 --> 00:22:09.904
lt's not the tuner.
lt's the antenna.

324
00:22:11.405 --> 00:22:12.974
Proby.
- What?

325
00:22:12.974 --> 00:22:16.269
Point the antenna out from under the house.

326
00:22:16.269 --> 00:22:19.080
There it is.

327
00:22:23.042 --> 00:22:25.042
Proby, walk away.

328
00:22:30.883 --> 00:22:32.285
Satch, grab a seat.

329
00:22:32.285 --> 00:22:35.079
Sully, l think l need a new set of cleats.

330
00:22:35.079 --> 00:22:37.179
l lost my footing there.

331
00:22:39.266 --> 00:22:42.071
Dr. De Leon,
you decided to join us.

332
00:22:42.353 --> 00:22:43.713
You don't want to know.

333
00:22:43.713 --> 00:22:47.258
Thirty-six hours,
l was bouncing off the walls.

334
00:22:47.258 --> 00:22:49.719
That's why you're the doctor,
l am the nurse.

335
00:22:49.719 --> 00:22:51.345
Can l get you something?

336
00:22:51.345 --> 00:22:52.763
No. lt's all right.

337
00:22:52.763 --> 00:22:54.990
ln left field, Don Buford.

338
00:22:55.491 --> 00:22:57.956
Paul Blair is in centrefield.

339
00:22:59.036 --> 00:23:01.397
How you boys doing?
- Good, Satch.

340
00:23:01.397 --> 00:23:04.875
OK. l have got something for you.

341
00:23:05.376 --> 00:23:07.376
l can't believe it.

342
00:23:07.586 --> 00:23:09.796
And l got something for you.

343
00:23:10.381 --> 00:23:12.825
Dad, look.
- What? You got to be--

344
00:23:12.825 --> 00:23:15.202
Hey, Satch, what are you,
Santa Claus or something?

345
00:23:15.202 --> 00:23:17.763
Game three tickets.

346
00:23:18.264 --> 00:23:19.999
Did you say thank you?
- Thank you.

347
00:23:19.999 --> 00:23:22.099
You're welcome.

348
00:23:22.099 --> 00:23:23.419
Thank you, Satch.

349
00:23:23.419 --> 00:23:26.505
Hey, all right.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

350
00:23:26.505 --> 00:23:30.005
Everybody.
Everybody say, 'Amazing Mets.'

351
00:23:30.005 --> 00:23:32.069
Amazing Mets.

352
00:23:52.381 --> 00:23:54.575
Don't choke on your pride, Sul.

353
00:23:54.575 --> 00:23:57.411
You ain't never going to
find another one like Sam.

354
00:23:57.411 --> 00:24:00.498
She made up her mind, Satch.
Nothing l do is going to change it.

355
00:24:00.498 --> 00:24:02.291
Nothing you're willing to do.

356
00:24:02.291 --> 00:24:04.710
What's the story?
- Construction crew found a body.

357
00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:07.021
Actually, a skeleton.

358
00:24:10.483 --> 00:24:14.862
OK. Well, be real careful
when you pull it out.

359
00:24:15.363 --> 00:24:18.508
Make sure you get the dirt around it.

360
00:24:18.949 --> 00:24:20.226
What's this construction?

361
00:24:20.226 --> 00:24:23.437
l think l will visit the neighbours, Satch.

362
00:24:23.437 --> 00:24:26.148
Yeah, OK.
What did they tear down here?

363
00:24:26.148 --> 00:24:27.942
Greek diner.

364
00:24:27.942 --> 00:24:31.445
l used to get breakfast there all the time.

365
00:24:31.445 --> 00:24:33.614
Them Greeks were good people.

366
00:24:33.614 --> 00:24:35.241
Careful. lt's hot.

367
00:24:35.241 --> 00:24:36.951
Thank you, Mrs Shepard.

368
00:24:36.951 --> 00:24:39.120
Once that McDonald's
opened up on Dyckman...

369
00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.685
they lost all their business.

370
00:24:41.685 --> 00:24:44.569
l see your son's on the job.
- Was.

371
00:24:45.017 --> 00:24:47.686
Jack died a while back.

372
00:24:48.187 --> 00:24:50.187
lt's hard. l know.

373
00:24:50.481 --> 00:24:52.861
lt just seems like yesterday.

374
00:24:54.193 --> 00:24:56.488
My son lived and bled blue.

375
00:24:56.987 --> 00:24:59.140
Get out of here.
- OK, Detective.

376
00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:02.215
Give my regards to Beth.
- Sure will.

377
00:25:05.454 --> 00:25:07.732
This isn't going to be anything
but a history lesson.

378
00:25:07.732 --> 00:25:10.042
Let's go back to the house.

379
00:25:23.681 --> 00:25:25.750
Hey, Barney. How you doing?

380
00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:27.850
Good.

381
00:25:28.185 --> 00:25:30.820
Here you go. Have a good night.

382
00:25:33.524 --> 00:25:35.843
l thought it'd be nicer to eat here.

383
00:25:35.843 --> 00:25:37.987
Sounds good.

384
00:25:38.487 --> 00:25:40.973
l am sorry Samantha couldn't make it.

385
00:25:40.973 --> 00:25:46.162
Those grad school applications
are driving her crazy.

386
00:25:48.205 --> 00:25:49.398
How's it coming?

387
00:25:49.398 --> 00:25:52.693
l got the VCR hooked up.
lt's just this frigging clock.

388
00:25:52.693 --> 00:25:54.793
Doesn't matter.

389
00:25:58.632 --> 00:25:59.992
l am sorry, Mom.

390
00:25:59.992 --> 00:26:02.092
l know. lt's all right.

391
00:26:02.428 --> 00:26:05.318
l am sure everything will work out.

392
00:26:05.318 --> 00:26:06.707
What's that?

393
00:26:06.707 --> 00:26:08.167
With Sam.

394
00:26:08.167 --> 00:26:11.671
Oh, yeah, you know,
just a tough time right now.

395
00:26:11.671 --> 00:26:14.576
So how are things at the hospital?

396
00:26:14.815 --> 00:26:18.110
Fine.
Dr Schwartz retired last month.

397
00:26:18.611 --> 00:26:19.971
No kidding.

398
00:26:19.971 --> 00:26:23.641
He must have been pushing 90.
- Close, yeah.

399
00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.436
So how'd you like 'The Lion King'?

400
00:26:27.436 --> 00:26:29.605
l loved it.
lt was sweet, kid.

401
00:26:29.605 --> 00:26:30.940
l wish you'd gone.

402
00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:33.484
Yeah, l know.
l am sorry. lt's work.

403
00:26:33.484 --> 00:26:36.087
Yeah, well, you work too hard.

404
00:26:36.587 --> 00:26:38.587
Look who's talking.

405
00:26:48.933 --> 00:26:52.561
lt's tomorrow.
- Thirty years.

406
00:26:55.606 --> 00:26:58.009
l wish l could remember him better.

407
00:26:58.009 --> 00:27:00.152
He was just a big kid.

408
00:27:00.653 --> 00:27:03.014
He wanted to play baseball forever.

409
00:27:03.014 --> 00:27:07.034
And fighting fires,
he loved that.

410
00:27:07.535 --> 00:27:12.331
And you, he loved you.

411
00:27:13.874 --> 00:27:16.001
OK, guys. Bedtime.

412
00:27:17.461 --> 00:27:18.654
Looking good.

413
00:27:18.654 --> 00:27:20.740
We will do it again tomorrow,
Chief.

414
00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.883
Good night, Dad.

415
00:27:26.429 --> 00:27:29.724
CQ-15. CQ-15.

416
00:27:30.224 --> 00:27:36.355
W2QYV calling unidentified station Queens.

417
00:27:36.856 --> 00:27:37.576
CQ-15?

418
00:27:40.651 --> 00:27:44.221
W2QYV calling unidentified station Queens.

419
00:27:44.655 --> 00:27:47.199
CQ-15, come in, Queens.

420
00:27:51.328 --> 00:27:52.980
ls that you?

421
00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.608
l have been trying to 'Q' you
all night. Where you been?

422
00:27:55.608 --> 00:27:58.627
How the hell did you do it?

423
00:27:59.962 --> 00:28:01.530
Do what?

424
00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:03.074
Do what? The series.

425
00:28:03.074 --> 00:28:06.452
You called Buford's homer.
How the hell did you do it?

426
00:28:06.452 --> 00:28:09.956
lt wasn't too tough, buddy.
The game happened 30 years ago.

427
00:28:09.956 --> 00:28:12.792
Yeah, right. Yeah,
thirty years ago. Yeah, sure.

428
00:28:12.792 --> 00:28:15.419
l suppose you could tell me
what happened in game two?

429
00:28:15.419 --> 00:28:18.965
Sure. Top of the ninth, Al Weis,
game-winning RBl single.

430
00:28:18.965 --> 00:28:22.635
Brooks Robinson
grounds out to end the game.

431
00:28:23.069 --> 00:28:25.346
Daddy, come up
and sing the baseball song.

432
00:28:25.346 --> 00:28:28.166
Hey, Little Chief.
You all right?

433
00:28:28.824 --> 00:28:32.578
Just go on up.
l will be there in a minute.

434
00:28:33.996 --> 00:28:36.315
Sorry about that.
That was my kid.

435
00:28:36.315 --> 00:28:37.733
What'd you just say?

436
00:28:37.733 --> 00:28:39.694
Sorry about that.
My kid just came in.

437
00:28:39.694 --> 00:28:42.599
You call your son 'Little Chief'?

438
00:28:44.715 --> 00:28:47.180
What'd you say your name was?

439
00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:49.303
Frank. Frank Sullivan.

440
00:28:49.804 --> 00:28:51.330
ls this some kind of joke?

441
00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:53.874
Gordo, is that you?
Are you messing with me?

442
00:28:53.874 --> 00:28:56.669
l ain't messing with you.
l am just trying to figure out--

443
00:28:56.669 --> 00:28:58.504
You're telling me
your name is Frank Sullivan...

444
00:28:58.504 --> 00:29:00.756
you live in Queens,
and you want to know......

445
00:29:00.756 --> 00:29:04.885
how l called the first game
of the 1969 World Series?

446
00:29:04.885 --> 00:29:08.139
Yeah, that's exactly what l want to know.

447
00:29:08.139 --> 00:29:12.243
Gordo, if this is you,
so help me.

448
00:29:12.743 --> 00:29:14.270
What'd you say--
- Gordo?

449
00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:19.215
What'd you say your call station
or your call letters were?

450
00:29:20.292 --> 00:29:21.012
W2QYV.

451
00:29:26.382 --> 00:29:28.242
Now you listen to me.

452
00:29:28.242 --> 00:29:30.494
My name is John Francis Sullivan.

453
00:29:30.494 --> 00:29:34.707
l live at 343 42nd Avenue,
where l have lived my whole life.

454
00:29:34.707 --> 00:29:38.717
l saw the first game
of the 1969 World Series...

455
00:29:38.717 --> 00:29:40.838
right here in this house thirty years ago.

456
00:29:40.838 --> 00:29:42.173
Bullshit.

457
00:29:42.173 --> 00:29:44.842
My father's name is Francis Patrick Sullivan.

458
00:29:44.842 --> 00:29:48.387
He was a fire-fighter and a die-hard Metsfan.

459
00:29:48.387 --> 00:29:50.097
Every night...
- Bullshit.

460
00:29:50.097 --> 00:29:54.022
...he sang to me
'Take Me Out to the Ballgame.'

461
00:29:56.704 --> 00:29:59.081
Who the hell are you?

462
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Son of a bitch.

463
00:30:03.711 --> 00:30:05.321
What's going on?

464
00:30:05.321 --> 00:30:07.421
Nothing's going on.

465
00:30:14.346 --> 00:30:15.623
Oh, my God.

466
00:30:15.623 --> 00:30:18.684
You burnt the desk.
l can see it.

467
00:30:19.185 --> 00:30:20.962
Are you still there?

468
00:30:20.962 --> 00:30:23.697
You burnt the desk.
l can see it.

469
00:30:27.985 --> 00:30:30.154
Come back. Talk to me.

470
00:30:35.201 --> 00:30:38.601
Listen to me.
You listen to me right now.

471
00:30:38.954 --> 00:30:41.565
l don't know who you are
or why you're doing this.

472
00:30:41.565 --> 00:30:43.484
But let me tell you something,
asshole.

473
00:30:43.484 --> 00:30:46.559
You stay away from me and my family.

474
00:30:46.559 --> 00:30:49.198
No, no, no.
You got to believe me.

475
00:30:49.198 --> 00:30:51.367
l don't know how this is happening...

476
00:30:51.367 --> 00:30:53.202
but it's me, Little Chief.

477
00:30:53.202 --> 00:30:55.682
Hey. Look. l am warning you.

478
00:30:55.682 --> 00:30:57.248
lf you touch my kid...

479
00:30:57.248 --> 00:31:01.683
l will hunt you down till
the day l die. You got that?

480
00:31:02.061 --> 00:31:03.754
But you already died.

481
00:31:03.754 --> 00:31:05.548
What are you talking about?

482
00:31:05.548 --> 00:31:07.648
The Buxton fire.

483
00:31:09.694 --> 00:31:11.596
When did that happen,
thirty years ago?

484
00:31:11.596 --> 00:31:13.696
October 12, 1969.

485
00:31:13.696 --> 00:31:15.683
Tomorrow. You're telling
me l am going to die-----

486
00:31:15.683 --> 00:31:17.852
l ain't dying in no fire tomorrow.

487
00:31:17.852 --> 00:31:20.438
My God, tomorrow. Listen.
Tomorrow hasn't happened.

488
00:31:20.438 --> 00:31:22.481
Right. lt hasn't happened.
lt ain't going to happen.

489
00:31:22.481 --> 00:31:24.900
You got to listen to me.
lt was an abandoned warehouse.

490
00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.569
Butch always told Ma it wasn't your fault.

491
00:31:26.569 --> 00:31:28.029
You went with your instincts.

492
00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:30.364
l am warning you.
- Listen to me.

493
00:31:30.364 --> 00:31:34.714
lf you'd gone the other way,
you would have made it.

494
00:31:43.436 --> 00:31:46.021
Hello? Shit.

495
00:32:15.217 --> 00:32:17.703
Sully, what are you doing, man?

496
00:32:17.703 --> 00:32:20.456
l talked to him, Gordo.
l talked to my dad.

497
00:32:20.456 --> 00:32:22.208
Sully, go in the house.

498
00:32:22.208 --> 00:32:24.585
l am going to come over,
and we will hang out.

499
00:32:24.585 --> 00:32:27.380
No. l got to get him back
so he doesn't go in.

500
00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.480
Go in? Go in where?

501
00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:32.712
The warehouse in Buxton.
lt's tomorrow.

502
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.862
Yeah, right. Yeah,
thirty years ago. Yeah, sure.

503
00:32:51.862 --> 00:32:55.199
l suppose you could tell me
what happened in game two?

504
00:32:55.199 --> 00:33:00.059
Sure. Top of the ninth, Al Weis,
game-winning RBl single.

505
00:33:01.305 --> 00:33:04.183
Come on. Come on.
Hit it out, Al.

506
00:33:05.643 --> 00:33:08.108
Look at the stats.
Look at them.

507
00:33:11.774 --> 00:33:13.774
Yeah, all right.

508
00:33:16.195 --> 00:33:19.657
We have a 3 and 2 response.
Ladder 93.

509
00:33:20.157 --> 00:33:21.517
You're first due.

510
00:33:21.517 --> 00:33:24.270
Flash is reported to be
an abandoned warehouse...

511
00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:26.230
at the foot of Water Street and Third.

512
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:28.190
You got some construction-limited access.

513
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:31.095
Al Weis is having a great series.

514
00:33:55.317 --> 00:33:57.317
Yeah. We won.

515
00:33:58.988 --> 00:34:02.533
Frank. You all right?

516
00:34:29.643 --> 00:34:31.643
We know it's vacant.

517
00:34:31.896 --> 00:34:34.786
Nobody goes in.
Surround and drown.

518
00:34:38.819 --> 00:34:40.304
Call for a tower.

519
00:34:40.304 --> 00:34:42.404
Help.

520
00:34:42.404 --> 00:34:44.517
Shit. We got squatters inside.

521
00:34:44.517 --> 00:34:46.617
Help.

522
00:34:49.038 --> 00:34:50.606
Help. Help.

523
00:34:50.606 --> 00:34:52.108
My sister.

524
00:34:52.108 --> 00:34:54.026
She's up there. She passed out.

525
00:34:54.026 --> 00:34:55.653
Where's your sister?
What floor?

526
00:34:55.653 --> 00:34:58.114
l tried to help.
- Tell me what floor.

527
00:34:58.114 --> 00:34:59.782
On the top floor.

528
00:34:59.782 --> 00:35:03.427
l tried. l tried.
Please help her. Please.

529
00:35:03.928 --> 00:35:07.838
Take her. Come on, Proby.
Anybody else up there?

530
00:35:18.359 --> 00:35:21.404
Ryan, get her medical treatment.

531
00:35:33.416 --> 00:35:35.459
Give me my gear.

532
00:35:39.672 --> 00:35:41.672
Hey, Sul.
- Satch.

533
00:35:41.672 --> 00:35:45.428
Here he is.
How you feeling, Sul?

534
00:35:45.928 --> 00:35:47.538
What can l tell you?

535
00:35:47.538 --> 00:35:49.165
Here you go.

536
00:35:49.165 --> 00:35:51.265
Better.

537
00:35:57.898 --> 00:36:01.444
No visible fire first or second floor.

538
00:36:04.155 --> 00:36:07.725
Watch your step, Proby.
This floor's rotten.

539
00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:14.732
We got fire on the third floor.
We're going up.

540
00:36:14.732 --> 00:36:18.317
Frank, we got two lines coming behind you.

541
00:36:42.485 --> 00:36:44.178
Back out, kid.
Wait for the line.

542
00:36:44.178 --> 00:36:46.305
The hell with the line.
l will find another way up.

543
00:36:46.305 --> 00:36:48.700
No, you can't help me, kid.

544
00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:19.772
So you doing OK, John?

545
00:37:20.272 --> 00:37:23.734
Yeah. Tough day, you know.

546
00:37:28.155 --> 00:37:30.366
Here's to your dad.

547
00:37:30.866 --> 00:37:32.476
Thirty years today.

548
00:37:32.476 --> 00:37:34.312
To your dad.

549
00:37:34.312 --> 00:37:37.498
To my dad.

550
00:37:41.794 --> 00:37:45.449
We're pulling everyone out of the building.

551
00:37:50.261 --> 00:37:52.680
Get that up to the top floor.

552
00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:54.707
lt's cooking up here.

553
00:37:54.707 --> 00:37:58.419
So after that Halloween thing
with the fire truck, remember?

554
00:37:58.419 --> 00:38:01.297
l remember riding around
with Butch and your dad...

555
00:38:01.297 --> 00:38:03.299
and the whole neighbourhood
was watching.

556
00:38:03.299 --> 00:38:05.885
l remember.
l wanted to go as a cop.

557
00:38:05.885 --> 00:38:08.763
Yeah, so then Jules makes your dad...

558
00:38:08.763 --> 00:38:10.932
buy you that cop kit for your birthday.

559
00:38:10.932 --> 00:38:13.032
l remember that.

560
00:38:13.032 --> 00:38:15.269
l was always the robber.
l was always being handcuffed.

561
00:38:15.269 --> 00:38:18.429
That's right.
l taught you to do that.

562
00:38:43.856 --> 00:38:46.609
Ten-forty-five.
l found the girl.

563
00:38:47.109 --> 00:38:49.574
She's breathing.
- Get them out.

564
00:39:00.748 --> 00:39:05.544
Hang on.
What the hell is going on?

565
00:39:06.045 --> 00:39:07.488
Gino, what's the matter?

566
00:39:07.488 --> 00:39:09.657
The gear box, it's cracked.

567
00:39:09.657 --> 00:39:12.562
Frank. Frank.
The ladder's jammed.

568
00:39:12.843 --> 00:39:14.829
You got to find another way out.

569
00:39:14.829 --> 00:39:17.640
Frank, can you hear me?

570
00:39:31.404 --> 00:39:32.597
lt worked out OK.

571
00:39:32.597 --> 00:39:34.932
You're a better cop than a fireman.

572
00:39:34.932 --> 00:39:36.267
No doubt about it.

573
00:39:36.267 --> 00:39:38.185
Worked out good for me, too.

574
00:39:38.185 --> 00:39:41.439
l am glad l didn't have to spend
ten years as his hose man.

575
00:39:41.439 --> 00:39:44.917
Yeah, l bet you are.

576
00:39:49.004 --> 00:39:50.615
The Buxton fire.

577
00:39:50.615 --> 00:39:53.605
lf you had just gone the other way.

578
00:40:16.699 --> 00:40:18.601
Frank,
we're losing the building.

579
00:40:18.601 --> 00:40:20.828
l know.

580
00:41:28.896 --> 00:41:31.616
Hey, hey, hey.
This is not a toy.

581
00:41:43.619 --> 00:41:44.729
Wave to Ma.

582
00:41:44.729 --> 00:41:46.829
Ma, look at us.

583
00:42:01.679 --> 00:42:03.679
He's some ball player.

584
00:42:19.739 --> 00:42:21.739
John, you all right?

585
00:42:22.324 --> 00:42:24.143
l am sorry.
- What is it?

586
00:42:24.143 --> 00:42:28.153
ls everything OK?
- Yeah. Can you bring a towel?

587
00:42:46.223 --> 00:42:49.585
Satch, my father didn't die in a fire, right?

588
00:42:49.585 --> 00:42:52.660
Gordo,
my father didn't die in a fire.

589
00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:01.525
What are you talking about,
Johnny? He had cancer.

590
00:43:05.368 --> 00:43:08.813
Cancer. Because it was
the cigarettes, right?

591
00:43:08.813 --> 00:43:11.633
Yeah, lung cancer,
ten years ago.

592
00:43:22.426 --> 00:43:24.120
Little Chief.

593
00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:27.540
Gordo, l ain't dreaming here.
l talked to him. lt was real.

594
00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:30.142
Little Chief.

595
00:43:30.643 --> 00:43:32.938
What are you talking about?

596
00:43:32.938 --> 00:43:35.020
lt was a ham radio.

597
00:43:35.231 --> 00:43:37.781
That's how come he didn't die.

598
00:43:38.275 --> 00:43:42.279
Little Chief.

599
00:43:48.035 --> 00:43:50.585
That's how come he didn't die.

600
00:43:51.122 --> 00:43:55.209
John. John Sullivan,
are you there?

601
00:43:55.918 --> 00:43:58.129
Come on. Answer me.

602
00:44:01.173 --> 00:44:04.135
Chief. Chief, are you there?

603
00:44:04.635 --> 00:44:06.971
l am right here, Daddy.

604
00:44:08.347 --> 00:44:10.124
Come here.

605
00:44:10.124 --> 00:44:11.084
Come on.

606
00:44:16.856 --> 00:44:18.966
Where's Elvis?
- He's sleeping.

607
00:44:18.966 --> 00:44:21.969
Why aren't you sleeping?
- You woke me up.

608
00:44:21.969 --> 00:44:22.689
l did?

609
00:44:27.116 --> 00:44:28.976
l got an idea.

610
00:44:28.976 --> 00:44:31.076
What's that?

611
00:44:34.206 --> 00:44:36.206
All right, Chief.

612
00:44:36.667 --> 00:44:39.727
What do you say we tame this bronco?

613
00:44:40.087 --> 00:44:41.572
l am scared.

614
00:44:41.572 --> 00:44:43.966
l know.
And you know what?

615
00:44:44.467 --> 00:44:46.953
l am going to be right here with you.

616
00:44:46.953 --> 00:44:49.053
Always.

617
00:44:49.053 --> 00:44:51.055
Daddy, l can't.

618
00:44:51.055 --> 00:44:54.113
Well, we can.
We can do it together.

619
00:44:54.351 --> 00:44:55.544
You and me.

620
00:44:55.544 --> 00:44:58.364
Spirit and guts.
What do you say?

621
00:44:59.523 --> 00:45:01.523
All right. Come on.

622
00:45:02.276 --> 00:45:04.653
Now, you just take your time.

623
00:45:05.154 --> 00:45:08.933
l am not going to let go until you say it's OK.

624
00:45:08.933 --> 00:45:11.243
All right.
Start pedalling.

625
00:45:11.619 --> 00:45:13.913
That's it.
Get your balance.

626
00:45:14.413 --> 00:45:15.564
Ready?
- Wait.

627
00:45:15.564 --> 00:45:17.664
OK, l am still here.

628
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.443
All right.
lt's all you.

629
00:45:19.443 --> 00:45:20.653
Look at me.

630
00:45:20.653 --> 00:45:22.753
lt's all you, Chief.

631
00:45:23.005 --> 00:45:24.323
Look at me, Dad.

632
00:45:24.323 --> 00:45:26.575
Look at you.
You're doing it.

633
00:45:26.575 --> 00:45:29.225
l am doing it.
- You're doing it.

634
00:45:30.805 --> 00:45:32.890
How's it feel?
- Good.

635
00:45:34.725 --> 00:45:36.002
This is great.

636
00:45:36.002 --> 00:45:38.004
lt's like l am on a flying trapeze.

637
00:45:38.004 --> 00:45:39.964
Look at you.
- This feels great.

638
00:45:39.964 --> 00:45:42.383
You're going around the world.
- lt's like flying.

639
00:45:42.383 --> 00:45:46.053
Wait will your mother sees this.
- Look at me.

640
00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:49.407
Let's wake up the world, huh?

641
00:46:30.364 --> 00:46:31.684
Oh, my God.

642
00:47:26.212 --> 00:47:28.212
John Sullivan?

643
00:47:30.341 --> 00:47:32.468
lt's me.

644
00:47:41.811 --> 00:47:44.276
You're the voice of an angel.

645
00:47:44.522 --> 00:47:45.965
Reached right out of heaven...

646
00:47:45.965 --> 00:47:49.485
and you pulled my butt out of the fire.

647
00:47:49.985 --> 00:47:51.971
Tell me l am not dreaming here.

648
00:47:51.971 --> 00:47:54.156
Tell me it's really you.

649
00:47:54.657 --> 00:47:58.244
lt's me, John.
This ain't no dream.

650
00:47:58.744 --> 00:48:00.229
But how could it be?

651
00:48:00.229 --> 00:48:02.023
l don't know.

652
00:48:02.023 --> 00:48:05.735
But we got to be talking off
the mother sunspot of all time.

653
00:48:05.735 --> 00:48:07.835
Yeah, l'd say so.

654
00:48:11.465 --> 00:48:13.465
You OK, Chief?

655
00:48:14.343 --> 00:48:16.343
Yeah, l am fine.

656
00:48:16.804 --> 00:48:18.804
You sure?

657
00:48:19.056 --> 00:48:21.267
Yeah, it's...

658
00:48:21.767 --> 00:48:25.229
lt's tough to explain.

659
00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:28.758
l mean, l got all these
new memories, but it's...

660
00:48:28.758 --> 00:48:30.843
it's like l don't know what to believe.

661
00:48:30.843 --> 00:48:32.762
What do you mean?

662
00:48:32.762 --> 00:48:34.513
because l still remember what it was like...

663
00:48:34.513 --> 00:48:36.140
when you died in the fire.

664
00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:37.558
But l am the only one.

665
00:48:37.558 --> 00:48:41.020
l don't understand
what you're talking about.

666
00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:44.290
l remember both...
at the same time.

667
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:47.526
And...it's like waking up from a dream...

668
00:48:47.526 --> 00:48:49.445
and you're not sure what's real.

669
00:48:49.445 --> 00:48:53.074
l remember you being here, but l
also remember when you weren't.

670
00:48:53.074 --> 00:48:55.634
l am sorry, John.

671
00:48:56.135 --> 00:48:58.287
l am sorry.
l never thought that--

672
00:48:58.287 --> 00:49:00.331
Well,
you got to think about that...

673
00:49:00.331 --> 00:49:04.210
and you got to be more careful,
because l can't lose you again.

674
00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:06.310
Not like that.

675
00:49:08.606 --> 00:49:10.816
You won't, John.
You won't.

676
00:49:11.025 --> 00:49:13.844
l swear to God,
no matter what, not like that.

677
00:49:13.844 --> 00:49:15.805
You got it? You hear me?

678
00:49:15.805 --> 00:49:17.905
You hear me, Chief?

679
00:49:17.905 --> 00:49:20.032
l hear you.

680
00:49:24.789 --> 00:49:27.333
So how old are you?

681
00:49:28.959 --> 00:49:31.128
l am thirty-six.

682
00:49:31.629 --> 00:49:33.406
Thirty-six.

683
00:49:33.406 --> 00:49:35.324
You're all grown up.

684
00:49:35.324 --> 00:49:38.484
You got to be married and everything.

685
00:49:38.928 --> 00:49:41.347
No, l am not married.

686
00:49:41.847 --> 00:49:44.333
What, you're too busy playing ball?

687
00:49:44.333 --> 00:49:47.478
No, it didn't work out.

688
00:49:47.978 --> 00:49:49.978
l gave it up.

689
00:49:49.978 --> 00:49:51.215
What happened?

690
00:49:51.215 --> 00:49:55.194
l just...blew my arm out my senior year.

691
00:49:55.695 --> 00:49:57.346
Didn't have a shot.

692
00:49:57.346 --> 00:49:59.682
Oh, l am sorry.
l am sorry, Johnny.

693
00:49:59.682 --> 00:50:01.822
l know that had to hurt.

694
00:50:01.822 --> 00:50:04.453
Yeah. Thanks.

695
00:50:04.954 --> 00:50:07.315
So, what'd you wind up doing?

696
00:50:07.315 --> 00:50:08.733
You join the department?

697
00:50:08.733 --> 00:50:12.503
Actually, l went the other way.

698
00:50:13.003 --> 00:50:15.003
l am a cop.

699
00:50:16.674 --> 00:50:18.534
You're third-generation fire-fighter.

700
00:50:18.534 --> 00:50:21.078
l thought you were going to
grow out of that cop phase.

701
00:50:21.078 --> 00:50:23.623
You got Satch to thank for that one.

702
00:50:23.623 --> 00:50:25.625
You got to be kidding me.

703
00:50:25.625 --> 00:50:26.876
Satch.

704
00:50:26.876 --> 00:50:31.141
He always crazy about you
ever since you were born.

705
00:50:34.275 --> 00:50:36.944
You're still my Little Chief.

706
00:50:37.403 --> 00:50:38.123
Right?

707
00:50:41.574 --> 00:50:45.202
Yeah, l am trying to be.

708
00:50:45.703 --> 00:50:47.705
l am trying.

709
00:50:50.958 --> 00:50:53.027
Well, tell me about yourself.

710
00:50:53.027 --> 00:50:55.463
Tell me about your life.

711
00:50:55.963 --> 00:51:00.301
l mean,
where do l start, you know?

712
00:51:00.801 --> 00:51:03.162
Mustang? l don't own a Mustang.

713
00:51:03.162 --> 00:51:06.474
Well, you will,
and you loved it.

714
00:51:06.974 --> 00:51:09.251
Fire-engine red.
Four on the floor.

715
00:51:09.251 --> 00:51:10.503
Seventy home runs?

716
00:51:10.503 --> 00:51:12.129
That's a record that will never be broken.

717
00:51:12.129 --> 00:51:15.549
l wouldn't be too sure.
The other guy hit sixty-six.

718
00:51:15.549 --> 00:51:17.802
Really? You mean like
those bigfield radios...

719
00:51:17.802 --> 00:51:19.220
they use in the army?

720
00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:20.429
No, much smaller.

721
00:51:20.429 --> 00:51:22.265
Works off a satellite or something.

722
00:51:22.265 --> 00:51:24.308
You carry it around in your pocket.

723
00:51:24.308 --> 00:51:27.603
What about 'Apollo'?
How did it all work out?

724
00:51:27.603 --> 00:51:29.939
lt was a great series, Pop.
Amazing.

725
00:51:29.939 --> 00:51:31.148
We win, right?

726
00:51:31.148 --> 00:51:33.192
Hold your horses.
l am getting there.

727
00:51:33.192 --> 00:51:34.986
Game three,
Agee came through...

728
00:51:34.986 --> 00:51:36.612
homered off Palmer in the second.

729
00:51:36.612 --> 00:51:39.115
l knew Agee was going to have
a great series.

730
00:51:39.115 --> 00:51:40.533
Forget about Agee.

731
00:51:40.533 --> 00:51:42.743
Wait until you hear
what happened to Cleon Jones.

732
00:51:42.743 --> 00:51:45.746
Now you sound like your mother.
- No, l am serious.

733
00:51:45.746 --> 00:51:47.331
Come on. Your grandfather...

734
00:51:47.331 --> 00:51:49.792
he smoked two packs a day,
and he's still kicking.

735
00:51:49.792 --> 00:51:54.146
Not you. lt's going to get the better of you.

736
00:51:59.443 --> 00:52:03.489
Well, l just knew.
She melted my heart.

737
00:52:03.989 --> 00:52:06.325
That was it.

738
00:52:06.826 --> 00:52:08.826
You got anybody?

739
00:52:09.078 --> 00:52:12.331
Yeah. Kind of.

740
00:52:13.541 --> 00:52:17.294
Something l got to work out,
but...

741
00:52:17.795 --> 00:52:19.964
she's worth it.

742
00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:25.720
No, you...go ahead.

743
00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:27.788
You get some rest.

744
00:52:27.788 --> 00:52:30.725
l am tired, too.

745
00:52:31.225 --> 00:52:34.880
l almost don't want to click off here, like...

746
00:52:35.187 --> 00:52:37.567
maybe we won't get this back.

747
00:52:37.815 --> 00:52:39.817
We will.

748
00:52:42.862 --> 00:52:45.114
l will be here tomorrow.

749
00:52:46.824 --> 00:52:49.035
l know.

750
00:53:00.421 --> 00:53:02.715
l love you, son.

751
00:53:06.343 --> 00:53:07.343
l...

752
00:53:09.805 --> 00:53:12.058
l love you, too, Dad.

753
00:53:12.558 --> 00:53:13.278
And...

754
00:53:15.061 --> 00:53:17.480
l have missed you so much.

755
00:53:37.083 --> 00:53:39.026
Hi. This is Julia Sullivan.

756
00:53:39.026 --> 00:53:42.271
Please leave a message after the tone.

757
00:53:42.588 --> 00:53:44.924
Hey, Ma. lt's me.

758
00:53:49.136 --> 00:53:52.098
Just call me. We got to talk.

759
00:54:18.916 --> 00:54:21.502
Take over for me?
- All right.

760
00:54:23.129 --> 00:54:24.447
Frank, what's going on?

761
00:54:24.447 --> 00:54:28.372
Nothing. l just wanted to see you, that's all.

762
00:54:29.468 --> 00:54:34.398
l am not going anywhere, Jules.
Not for the rest of your life.

763
00:54:37.101 --> 00:54:39.629
l got a bad feeling today.
l was worried.

764
00:54:39.629 --> 00:54:41.672
Look at me.
Not a scratch.

765
00:54:41.672 --> 00:54:42.882
Where's Johnny?

766
00:54:42.882 --> 00:54:45.702
He's at Gordo's.
l tucked him in.

767
00:54:45.702 --> 00:54:47.595
You give him his drops?

768
00:54:47.595 --> 00:54:49.695
One in each ear.

769
00:54:49.695 --> 00:54:51.557
What would you do without me?

770
00:54:51.557 --> 00:54:53.684
Probably marry some rich doctor.

771
00:54:53.684 --> 00:54:55.784
Never have to work.

772
00:54:56.078 --> 00:54:57.605
Oh, my God.
What is he doing?

773
00:54:57.605 --> 00:54:58.898
Frank, l got to--

774
00:54:58.898 --> 00:55:01.442
Excuse me, Doctor.
ls that Benazepril?

775
00:55:01.442 --> 00:55:03.569
l gave this patient fifty mils of Benadryl.

776
00:55:03.569 --> 00:55:04.946
Mix them and he's dead.

777
00:55:04.946 --> 00:55:08.531
Why wasn't l informed?
- lt's in his chart.

778
00:57:27.855 --> 00:57:29.006
Hello, Ma?

779
00:57:29.006 --> 00:57:30.299
Noah's Deli.

780
00:57:30.299 --> 00:57:32.399
Oh, no. Sorry.

781
00:57:41.619 --> 00:57:43.662
This is Noah's Deli.

782
00:58:00.763 --> 00:58:03.432
Sam, l got to talk to you.

783
00:58:03.891 --> 00:58:05.042
Excuse me?

784
00:58:05.042 --> 00:58:07.837
l am sorry,
but l got to talk to you.

785
00:58:07.837 --> 00:58:09.977
How do you know my name?

786
00:58:09.977 --> 00:58:11.799
Who are you?

787
00:58:11.799 --> 00:58:13.899
Who am l?

788
00:58:13.899 --> 00:58:15.678
Look. l don't know you.

789
00:58:15.678 --> 00:58:17.054
You don't know me?

790
00:58:17.054 --> 00:58:19.473
What do you mean,
you don't know me?

791
00:58:19.473 --> 00:58:21.573
Wait. l do know you.

792
00:58:21.992 --> 00:58:24.270
You're Linda and Gordo's friend.

793
00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:28.365
The neighbour. The cop.
What are you doing here?

794
00:58:34.755 --> 00:58:37.050
l shouldn't have come here.

795
00:58:37.508 --> 00:58:40.302
l didn't mean to upset you.

796
00:58:40.803 --> 00:58:42.803
l am sorry.

797
00:58:47.351 --> 00:58:49.646
Yeah, l will take care of it.

798
00:59:16.297 --> 00:59:17.615
What?

799
00:59:17.615 --> 00:59:18.991
Another rough night?

800
00:59:18.991 --> 00:59:20.451
ls that it?

801
00:59:20.451 --> 00:59:22.370
Yeah, that's it.

802
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:25.347
Do not disrespect me, John.

803
00:59:25.848 --> 00:59:27.833
Disrespect yourself all you want to...

804
00:59:27.833 --> 00:59:29.710
but not me or anybody else here.

805
00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:31.810
You got that?

806
00:59:39.653 --> 00:59:42.682
We got the preliminary forensics
back on the skeleton.

807
00:59:42.682 --> 00:59:45.493
You want to take a look at this.

808
00:59:53.834 --> 00:59:55.836
Bad memories.

809
00:59:56.337 --> 01:00:01.267
You imagine the odds of us
digging up a Nightingale murder?

810
01:00:01.267 --> 01:00:02.660
She makes ten.

811
01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:03.660
Ten?

812
01:00:04.637 --> 01:00:06.677
No, l remember this case.

813
01:00:06.677 --> 01:00:09.041
lt was three.
He killed three women.

814
01:00:09.041 --> 01:00:11.141
What are you talking?

815
01:00:11.477 --> 01:00:14.282
You know better than anybody,
John.

816
01:00:17.650 --> 01:00:21.135
You looked at these files a thousand times.

817
01:00:58.816 --> 01:01:00.818
Dad? You there?

818
01:01:02.319 --> 01:01:04.138
Can you hear me?

819
01:01:04.138 --> 01:01:06.618
Dad, l need you to be there.

820
01:01:06.618 --> 01:01:10.184
Yeah. Yeah, Chief.
l am coming, l am coming.

821
01:01:10.184 --> 01:01:13.432
Listen.
There's something l need to tell----

822
01:01:15.374 --> 01:01:17.374
Right here, Chief.

823
01:01:20.796 --> 01:01:23.240
Something happened.
Something pretty bad.

824
01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:25.409
What's the matter, Johnny?
What is it?

825
01:01:25.409 --> 01:01:27.995
Mom. Something happened to her.

826
01:01:27.995 --> 01:01:29.747
Your mom? What?

827
01:01:29.747 --> 01:01:31.847
She's not here.

828
01:01:31.847 --> 01:01:34.769
What do you mean,
she's not there?

829
01:01:37.229 --> 01:01:41.394
She died. But it's like
it just...happened, though.

830
01:01:41.859 --> 01:01:43.844
She died?
Your mom just died?

831
01:01:43.844 --> 01:01:47.089
No. Dad, it happened a long time ago.

832
01:01:47.365 --> 01:01:49.365
A long time ago for me.

833
01:01:49.365 --> 01:01:51.450
When?

834
01:01:51.827 --> 01:01:55.915
October 22, 1969.

835
01:01:57.333 --> 01:02:00.152
That's now, Johnny.
That's next week.

836
01:02:00.152 --> 01:02:03.881
You got to tell me how.

837
01:02:04.382 --> 01:02:05.574
She was murdered.

838
01:02:05.574 --> 01:02:07.326
Murdered?
What are you talking about?

839
01:02:07.326 --> 01:02:09.620
There was this case, a serial.

840
01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:12.331
They never caught him,
but he murdered three women...

841
01:02:12.331 --> 01:02:15.236
all nurses,
between 68th and 69th.

842
01:02:15.236 --> 01:02:16.669
They call him the Nightingale.

843
01:02:16.669 --> 01:02:17.878
The Nightingale?

844
01:02:17.878 --> 01:02:20.256
We have been watching that
on the news. l was worried--

845
01:02:20.256 --> 01:02:22.356
Dad, we did something.

846
01:02:22.650 --> 01:02:24.343
Something to make it worse.

847
01:02:24.343 --> 01:02:26.137
l don't understand.

848
01:02:26.137 --> 01:02:29.932
He didn't just kill three women
anymore. He's killed ten.

849
01:02:29.932 --> 01:02:32.101
Something we did changed the past.

850
01:02:32.101 --> 01:02:33.811
But how come your mother--

851
01:02:33.811 --> 01:02:36.397
Everything you did is different
than what would have happened.....

852
01:02:36.397 --> 01:02:38.441
if you would have never
gotten out of that warehouse.

853
01:02:38.441 --> 01:02:40.735
Now what'd you do last night,
Dad?

854
01:02:40.735 --> 01:02:42.835
l talked to you.

855
01:02:43.129 --> 01:02:45.464
l put you on the bike.

856
01:02:45.965 --> 01:02:47.491
l tucked you in over at Gordo's...

857
01:02:47.491 --> 01:02:50.328
and l went to see your mother
over at the hospital.

858
01:02:50.328 --> 01:02:52.428
Oh, shit. That's it.

859
01:02:52.428 --> 01:02:55.124
She wasn't supposed to be there.
Butch went and got her.

860
01:02:55.124 --> 01:02:57.168
That was the night of the fire
when he brought her home.

861
01:02:57.168 --> 01:02:58.753
You're saying something happened
at that hospital?

862
01:02:58.753 --> 01:03:00.004
That's just the beginning.

863
01:03:00.004 --> 01:03:02.340
lt could have been anywhere, place, time...

864
01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:03.966
that she wouldn't have been
if you would have died.

865
01:03:03.966 --> 01:03:05.593
l will take her away from here,
Johnny.

866
01:03:05.593 --> 01:03:07.011
l have to take her away.

867
01:03:07.011 --> 01:03:08.930
He cannot hurt her if l take her away.

868
01:03:08.930 --> 01:03:11.907
What about the others, Dad?

869
01:03:12.408 --> 01:03:13.809
l will warn them.

870
01:03:13.809 --> 01:03:15.895
That will never work.
They will just think you're crazy.

871
01:03:15.895 --> 01:03:17.980
But l got to do something.
l.....

872
01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:21.108
You don't even know
what this guy looks like.

873
01:03:21.108 --> 01:03:24.608
Nobody got any-- Hold on. Wait a minute.

874
01:03:26.547 --> 01:03:28.950
Dad, l may not know who he is...

875
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:30.493
but l know where he's going to be...

876
01:03:30.493 --> 01:03:32.203
and what he's going to do
before he gets there.

877
01:03:32.203 --> 01:03:34.705
What do l do?
Do l call the police?

878
01:03:34.705 --> 01:03:35.957
They're not going to believe me.

879
01:03:35.957 --> 01:03:37.917
They will if they catch him in the act.

880
01:03:37.917 --> 01:03:39.418
You can make that happen, Dad.

881
01:03:39.418 --> 01:03:41.504
No, Johnny. l don't know.

882
01:03:41.504 --> 01:03:43.005
l am a fire-fighter.

883
01:03:43.005 --> 01:03:44.840
l am a cop.
This is what l do.

884
01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:46.634
This is something we have to do.

885
01:03:46.634 --> 01:03:49.679
What if the ham stops working?
What if l can't reach you?

886
01:03:49.679 --> 01:03:51.222
Then you get Mom the hell out.

887
01:03:51.222 --> 01:03:55.059
But, Dad, those other women
were not supposed to die.

888
01:03:55.059 --> 01:03:57.103
lf we don't do something
and try to stop this guy...

889
01:03:57.103 --> 01:04:01.708
we will have to live with that
for the rest of our lives.

890
01:04:01.708 --> 01:04:04.460
OK, tell me what to do.

891
01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:06.070
All right.

892
01:04:06.070 --> 01:04:08.698
The next victim is Carrie Reynolds.

893
01:04:08.698 --> 01:04:10.283
lt happens tomorrow.

894
01:04:10.283 --> 01:04:12.952
Case file said she left
the Roosevelt Hospital at 6.00.

895
01:04:12.952 --> 01:04:15.204
Showed up at Cozy's Bar around 6.30.

896
01:04:15.204 --> 01:04:18.207
She walked out of that bar around 7.30...

897
01:04:18.207 --> 01:04:21.919
and they found her dead in
an alley behind the bar at 8.00.

898
01:04:21.919 --> 01:04:23.671
l want you to follow her...

899
01:04:23.671 --> 01:04:26.173
see if anybody's watching her
or hitting on her.

900
01:04:26.173 --> 01:04:28.884
because l am betting when she
walks out of that place...

901
01:04:28.884 --> 01:04:31.512
somebody's going to come
out of there with her.

902
01:04:31.512 --> 01:04:33.472
When they do,
you call the cops.

903
01:04:33.472 --> 01:04:34.682
Hi, Carrie.

904
01:04:34.682 --> 01:04:36.183
Hiya, Glen. How you doing?

905
01:04:36.183 --> 01:04:38.283
Real good.

906
01:05:25.374 --> 01:05:27.793
From the girls, pal.

907
01:05:35.634 --> 01:05:37.762
Thanks.

908
01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:46.003
l was...

909
01:05:46.003 --> 01:05:48.103
Sit down.

910
01:05:48.397 --> 01:05:50.508
Fireman, huh?
- Yeah. l am not really....

911
01:05:50.508 --> 01:05:52.608
Ah, a married fireman.

912
01:05:53.903 --> 01:05:56.878
What the hell.
What do they call you?

913
01:06:03.329 --> 01:06:05.831
7-4 Homicide.

914
01:06:06.332 --> 01:06:07.984
Yeah, it's me.

915
01:06:07.984 --> 01:06:10.084
You're kidding.

916
01:06:12.296 --> 01:06:15.132
Hold on. Spell that for me.

917
01:06:15.633 --> 01:06:18.803
OK. Thanks, Mario.

918
01:06:21.138 --> 01:06:24.041
Our lucky break.
Mario lD'd the dental.

919
01:06:24.041 --> 01:06:26.085
Her name is Mary Finelli.

920
01:06:26.085 --> 01:06:28.546
Reported missing April 16, 1968.

921
01:06:28.546 --> 01:06:32.858
April 16?
That means she was the first.

922
01:06:33.359 --> 01:06:36.164
Which means he probably knew her.

923
01:06:36.404 --> 01:06:38.404
This case just got hot.

924
01:06:40.616 --> 01:06:42.268
She's gone.

925
01:06:42.268 --> 01:06:44.918
Carrie Reynolds isn't in here.

926
01:06:46.622 --> 01:06:47.622
Who?

927
01:06:50.292 --> 01:06:52.292
He did it.

928
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:58.909
Carrie Reynolds is alive and well, Dad.

929
01:06:58.909 --> 01:07:00.494
l will be damned.

930
01:07:00.494 --> 01:07:02.413
Did you see him?

931
01:07:02.413 --> 01:07:04.624
Figure who he is?
- No, l messed up.

932
01:07:04.624 --> 01:07:06.459
l just kept talking to her.

933
01:07:06.459 --> 01:07:08.169
l was afraid to let her out of my sight.

934
01:07:08.169 --> 01:07:10.338
Whoever it was,
he must have backed off.

935
01:07:10.338 --> 01:07:13.674
That's OK. We're going to get him.
This is going to work.

936
01:07:13.674 --> 01:07:17.194
l hope so.
So, what else you got?

937
01:07:17.695 --> 01:07:21.010
We caught a break.
Found his first victim.

938
01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:22.934
Her name is Mary Finelli.

939
01:07:22.934 --> 01:07:25.811
Thanks, Mrs Sullivan.
- Hang on a sec, John.

940
01:07:25.811 --> 01:07:29.899
Hey, Jules, there's somebody
l want you to talk to. OK?

941
01:07:29.899 --> 01:07:32.818
Remember l told you about this guy, John?

942
01:07:32.818 --> 01:07:35.468
l want you to say hello to him.

943
01:07:36.547 --> 01:07:39.008
Say hello to my wife, Julia.

944
01:07:44.847 --> 01:07:46.832
Frank tells me you're a cop.

945
01:07:46.832 --> 01:07:48.793
Yeah, that's right.

946
01:07:48.793 --> 01:07:53.047
My six-year-old keeps telling us
he wants to be a policeman...

947
01:07:53.047 --> 01:07:54.799
right after he retires from the majors.

948
01:07:54.799 --> 01:07:58.552
We just bought him a badge
and a whistle for his birthday.

949
01:07:58.552 --> 01:08:01.639
Yeah, l remember. l used to play
cops and robbers all the time...

950
01:08:01.639 --> 01:08:04.475
but you....my mom wouldn't
let me have a toy gun.

951
01:08:04.475 --> 01:08:08.371
Sounds like your mom
and l would get along.

952
01:08:08.871 --> 01:08:12.149
Yeah, she's pretty special.
l am real proud of her.

953
01:08:12.149 --> 01:08:15.736
l bet she's proud of you, too.
Being a cop and all.

954
01:08:15.736 --> 01:08:17.838
l hope so.

955
01:08:18.339 --> 01:08:21.484
l hope she knows how much l love her.

956
01:08:21.884 --> 01:08:23.202
Oh, she knows.

957
01:08:23.202 --> 01:08:25.997
Moms always know how much
their kids love them.

958
01:08:25.997 --> 01:08:31.027
Even if they don't tell them
all the time, like they should.

959
01:08:31.477 --> 01:08:33.129
Well, l got to go.

960
01:08:33.129 --> 01:08:35.506
lt was good talking to you,
John.

961
01:08:35.506 --> 01:08:36.882
Yeah, you, too.

962
01:08:36.882 --> 01:08:38.509
l want to talk on Daddy's radio.

963
01:08:38.509 --> 01:08:39.885
OK, go ahead.

964
01:08:39.885 --> 01:08:41.679
OK, sweetheart.
Say good night to John.

965
01:08:41.679 --> 01:08:43.779
Good night, John.

966
01:08:45.908 --> 01:08:48.035
Good night, there, Chief.

967
01:08:49.370 --> 01:08:51.370
OK, guys. Bedtime.

968
01:08:51.831 --> 01:08:53.899
No. l want to talk on the radio, too.

969
01:08:53.899 --> 01:08:55.693
All right, Gordo. Come here.

970
01:08:55.693 --> 01:08:58.154
OK, Gordo, two minutes,
then bedtime.

971
01:08:58.154 --> 01:08:59.447
Sit right there.

972
01:08:59.447 --> 01:09:01.115
Just one more cookie, Mom.

973
01:09:01.115 --> 01:09:03.200
No more cookies.
- Just one more.

974
01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:04.827
This is the space cowboy.

975
01:09:04.827 --> 01:09:06.787
l am an intergalactic traveller...

976
01:09:06.787 --> 01:09:09.692
from the Federation planet Earth.

977
01:09:10.725 --> 01:09:13.445
How do you know my name, mister?

978
01:09:15.896 --> 01:09:19.041
Listen, Gordo,
my name is Santa Claus.

979
01:09:19.525 --> 01:09:20.968
l am going to give you...

980
01:09:20.968 --> 01:09:23.763
the biggest Christmas present
that you ever had.

981
01:09:23.763 --> 01:09:26.838
l better give you my address, then.

982
01:09:27.241 --> 01:09:30.311
No, don't worry about it, kid.
This is important.

983
01:09:30.311 --> 01:09:34.440
Something you got to remember
for a long time: Yahoo.

984
01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:36.540
What's that?

985
01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:39.070
lt's a magic word.
lt's like...

986
01:09:39.070 --> 01:09:41.975
like abracadabra,
but even better.

987
01:09:42.339 --> 01:09:44.592
Try it out, kid. Yahoo.

988
01:09:45.092 --> 01:09:46.786
Yahoo.

989
01:09:46.786 --> 01:09:48.663
You got it, Space Cowboy.

990
01:09:48.663 --> 01:09:50.289
OK, Gordo.
Your two minutes are up.

991
01:09:50.289 --> 01:09:52.625
Go upstairs and write it down.

992
01:09:52.625 --> 01:09:54.935
OK, mister. l mean, Santa.

993
01:09:54.935 --> 01:09:56.921
Come on. Let's go.

994
01:09:56.921 --> 01:09:59.090
Stay there, John.
l will be right back.

995
01:09:59.090 --> 01:10:00.299
Come on. Upstairs.

996
01:10:00.299 --> 01:10:04.653
Jules, we got a live one
down here. Coming your way.

997
01:10:05.946 --> 01:10:07.056
Yeah, Chief.

998
01:10:07.056 --> 01:10:08.724
You still there?

999
01:10:08.724 --> 01:10:10.864
Yeah. What do we do now?

1000
01:10:11.202 --> 01:10:12.853
Sissy Clark.

1001
01:10:12.853 --> 01:10:14.105
423 Greenwich Street--

1002
01:10:14.105 --> 01:10:16.332
Hang on. Go ahead.

1003
01:10:16.832 --> 01:10:18.025
Sissy Clark.

1004
01:10:18.025 --> 01:10:21.654
423 Greenwich Street,
Apartment 2E. Tomorrow.

1005
01:10:21.654 --> 01:10:23.072
OK. 2E.

1006
01:10:23.072 --> 01:10:26.534
Nurse. Moonlights as a cocktail waitress...

1007
01:10:26.534 --> 01:10:29.184
at the Kaleidoscope on West sixty-third.

1008
01:10:29.184 --> 01:10:31.847
Left work at 2.00 a.m.

1009
01:10:32.348 --> 01:10:36.513
Was killed in her apartment
between 2.15 and 5.00.

1010
01:10:37.019 --> 01:10:38.504
OK, l got it.

1011
01:10:38.504 --> 01:10:42.091
l don't know how long this thing
is going to keep working.

1012
01:10:42.091 --> 01:10:44.510
Hope we will be able to talk again.

1013
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:46.905
Just be careful, all right?

1014
01:11:21.939 --> 01:11:24.592
l am happy you found her,
Detective.

1015
01:11:24.592 --> 01:11:29.739
lt makes it easier now to know for sure.

1016
01:11:30.239 --> 01:11:32.450
You know.

1017
01:11:34.076 --> 01:11:38.122
Can l keep these for a while,
Mrs Finelli?

1018
01:11:38.622 --> 01:11:41.709
OK, just let me walk you through it.

1019
01:11:42.209 --> 01:11:44.028
l am all ears.

1020
01:11:44.028 --> 01:11:48.293
Three guys show up in both
the yearbook and diary.

1021
01:11:50.176 --> 01:11:53.236
First guy passed away ten years ago.

1022
01:11:53.929 --> 01:11:56.224
Second guy died in Vietnam.

1023
01:11:56.224 --> 01:11:59.727
And the third one's Daryl Simpson.

1024
01:12:00.227 --> 01:12:03.397
So l ran him through B.C.l.
Got a hit.

1025
01:12:03.898 --> 01:12:05.299
Busted for sexual assault...

1026
01:12:05.299 --> 01:12:07.385
eight days after
the last Nightingale murder.

1027
01:12:07.385 --> 01:12:09.904
March 22, 1970.

1028
01:12:10.404 --> 01:12:13.140
You think the murders stopped
because he was off the street...

1029
01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:15.184
and by the time he got paroled...

1030
01:12:15.184 --> 01:12:17.979
he had smartened up enough
to control himself?

1031
01:12:17.979 --> 01:12:20.398
That's not the first time that's been true.

1032
01:12:20.398 --> 01:12:22.566
l got a feeling about this guy.

1033
01:12:22.566 --> 01:12:24.668
This is him, Satch.

1034
01:12:45.773 --> 01:12:47.758
Can l get you another one?

1035
01:12:47.758 --> 01:12:49.858
No, thanks. l am good.

1036
01:12:52.822 --> 01:12:54.473
Anything else?

1037
01:12:54.473 --> 01:12:57.535
Sexual assault, Daryl.
Five years.

1038
01:12:58.035 --> 01:12:59.937
But you got lucky, right?

1039
01:12:59.937 --> 01:13:01.939
You got away with something else.

1040
01:13:01.939 --> 01:13:04.525
Something you figured
nobody knows about.

1041
01:13:04.525 --> 01:13:06.319
What l know is what l told you.

1042
01:13:06.319 --> 01:13:07.945
Let me tell you what l know.

1043
01:13:07.945 --> 01:13:09.530
You went to St. Ambrose with Mary.

1044
01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:11.073
You lived five blocks from her...

1045
01:13:11.073 --> 01:13:13.075
and you liked her,
but she ain't interested.

1046
01:13:13.075 --> 01:13:15.895
That must have hurt, huh?
- So what?

1047
01:13:15.895 --> 01:13:18.945
So what'd you do about it?
- Nothing.

1048
01:13:26.105 --> 01:13:28.107
Can l have a smoke?

1049
01:13:30.192 --> 01:13:33.154
Here. l am trying to quit.

1050
01:13:37.324 --> 01:13:40.453
Oh, my God. What is this?

1051
01:13:40.953 --> 01:13:44.081
Ah, Jesus.
Get that away from me.

1052
01:13:44.582 --> 01:13:47.234
Sandra Moore. Patti Ryan.
Mary Finelli.

1053
01:13:47.234 --> 01:13:49.487
These names mean anything to you, pal?

1054
01:13:49.487 --> 01:13:51.697
Julia Sullivan.
Does she mean anything?

1055
01:13:51.697 --> 01:13:54.800
Well, she means something to me.

1056
01:14:06.228 --> 01:14:08.673
See you, fireman.
Don't talk so much next time.

1057
01:14:08.673 --> 01:14:11.592
Gus, will you run my
tips while l go change?

1058
01:14:11.592 --> 01:14:13.692
Sure, Sissy.
- Thanks.

1059
01:14:31.462 --> 01:14:33.462
You know, Daryl...

1060
01:14:33.881 --> 01:14:35.533
sometimes,
despite all the training...

1061
01:14:35.533 --> 01:14:37.076
that we cops go through...

1062
01:14:37.076 --> 01:14:41.372
despite all that we are taught
about right and wrong...

1063
01:14:41.372 --> 01:14:46.062
despite all that we would
like to honour in ourselves...

1064
01:14:46.352 --> 01:14:48.477
we can come to a place...

1065
01:14:48.729 --> 01:14:51.440
where we don't give a damn.

1066
01:14:52.817 --> 01:14:55.027
Know what l mean?

1067
01:14:55.528 --> 01:14:58.431
You're going to tell me
everything l need to know.

1068
01:14:58.431 --> 01:15:01.409
John. You got a minute?

1069
01:15:01.909 --> 01:15:04.787
Yeah. Sure.

1070
01:15:11.210 --> 01:15:12.903
He ain't the guy, John.

1071
01:15:12.903 --> 01:15:15.406
Just because he didn't want
to look at the photos...

1072
01:15:15.406 --> 01:15:16.782
doesn't mean he isn't the one.

1073
01:15:16.782 --> 01:15:18.284
Not everyone fits the profile.

1074
01:15:18.284 --> 01:15:19.827
lf he was going to give up something...

1075
01:15:19.827 --> 01:15:22.307
he would have done it already.

1076
01:15:34.442 --> 01:15:37.862
You following me?
Huh? You following me?

1077
01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:43.117
l asked you a question, asshole.

1078
01:15:43.617 --> 01:15:45.617
Mary Finelli.

1079
01:16:14.648 --> 01:16:16.943
Dude, what happened to him?

1080
01:16:17.276 --> 01:16:19.276
lt was a bad trip, man.

1081
01:16:19.487 --> 01:16:21.931
A little time kissing
the porcelain, he will be fine.

1082
01:16:21.931 --> 01:16:23.391
Yeah, l understand that.

1083
01:16:23.391 --> 01:16:25.531
All right. Come on, pal.

1084
01:17:16.419 --> 01:17:19.964
Open up. Miss Clark.
Open the door.

1085
01:17:20.464 --> 01:17:22.366
lt's the police.
Open the door.

1086
01:17:22.366 --> 01:17:25.661
lt's OK, ma'am. Go back inside.
lt's the police.

1087
01:17:25.661 --> 01:17:27.622
Are you in there? Open up.

1088
01:17:27.622 --> 01:17:29.722
l know you're in there.

1089
01:17:31.517 --> 01:17:35.062
Sissy Clark. Open the door.
Open the door.

1090
01:18:22.818 --> 01:18:24.818
He killed her.

1091
01:18:26.197 --> 01:18:27.723
l couldn't do a damn thing to stop it.

1092
01:18:27.723 --> 01:18:29.684
Dad, it's not your fault.

1093
01:18:29.684 --> 01:18:31.018
Yes, it is.

1094
01:18:31.018 --> 01:18:33.396
We changed everything, Johnny.

1095
01:18:33.396 --> 01:18:34.855
lt's like we cheated.

1096
01:18:34.855 --> 01:18:36.995
Dad? We can't go back...

1097
01:18:37.458 --> 01:18:39.402
because you didn't die in that fire.

1098
01:18:39.402 --> 01:18:41.904
No matter what you do,
nothing is going to change it.

1099
01:18:41.904 --> 01:18:45.283
All we can do is deal with this
and try to make it right.

1100
01:18:45.283 --> 01:18:47.576
l am not a cop.
l am not fooling anybody.

1101
01:18:47.576 --> 01:18:49.036
l know, but we can.

1102
01:18:49.036 --> 01:18:52.498
We can do it together.
Remember spirit and guts?

1103
01:18:52.498 --> 01:18:56.310
John,
he's got my driver's licence.

1104
01:18:56.811 --> 01:18:58.379
What?

1105
01:18:58.379 --> 01:19:01.674
He took my driver's licence.
He knows where we live.

1106
01:19:01.674 --> 01:19:04.135
He took your dr....
He took your wallet?

1107
01:19:04.135 --> 01:19:07.221
Well, he tossed the wallet,
but he kept the licence.

1108
01:19:07.221 --> 01:19:08.639
He touched your wallet?
Where's your wallet?

1109
01:19:08.639 --> 01:19:09.974
lt's in my pocket.

1110
01:19:09.974 --> 01:19:12.226
We got him, Dad. You got him.

1111
01:19:12.226 --> 01:19:14.270
His prints. You got his prints.

1112
01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:16.314
You got to get me that wallet.

1113
01:19:16.314 --> 01:19:18.733
How the hell am l supposed to do that?

1114
01:19:18.733 --> 01:19:20.401
As carefully as possible.

1115
01:19:20.401 --> 01:19:22.528
Take your wallet out,
but just touch the corners.

1116
01:19:22.528 --> 01:19:24.655
What are you talking about?
- Just do it.

1117
01:19:24.655 --> 01:19:26.795
OK, all right.
All right.

1118
01:19:27.216 --> 01:19:29.243
Right.
- OK. All right. l got it.

1119
01:19:29.243 --> 01:19:31.162
All right. Now. Listen.

1120
01:19:31.162 --> 01:19:33.302
l want you to wrap it up.

1121
01:19:33.302 --> 01:19:35.541
Put it in one of them plastic bags...

1122
01:19:35.541 --> 01:19:37.209
you keep extra transistors in.

1123
01:19:37.209 --> 01:19:39.086
Yeah. l see where you're going.

1124
01:19:39.086 --> 01:19:42.089
Beautiful. OK.
Now hide it somewhere.

1125
01:19:42.089 --> 01:19:46.886
Somewhere where nobody's going to
find it for the next 30 years.

1126
01:19:46.886 --> 01:19:48.596
l think maybe....
- Where?

1127
01:19:48.596 --> 01:19:51.098
The window seat in the dining room.

1128
01:19:51.098 --> 01:19:54.185
There's a loose board
on the left, on the bottom.

1129
01:19:54.185 --> 01:19:56.285
Perfect. Beautiful.

1130
01:20:12.595 --> 01:20:13.913
lt's in.

1131
01:20:13.913 --> 01:20:16.307
Great. OK, l am after it.

1132
01:20:27.401 --> 01:20:28.636
We're in business.

1133
01:20:28.636 --> 01:20:31.541
Now just sit tight and don't worry.

1134
01:21:02.770 --> 01:21:04.770
And the winner is....

1135
01:21:06.148 --> 01:21:08.734
Oh, man. lt's a cop.

1136
01:21:09.235 --> 01:21:11.235
What the hell?

1137
01:21:19.245 --> 01:21:21.288
Son of a bitch.

1138
01:21:35.177 --> 01:21:38.139
Hey, Mr Shepard.
How are you?

1139
01:21:38.639 --> 01:21:40.291
Who's that?
Oh, hi, Detective.

1140
01:21:40.291 --> 01:21:42.960
l just came by to wrap things up over there.

1141
01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:44.503
Thought l'd say hello.

1142
01:21:44.503 --> 01:21:47.440
Glad you did. Come on in.

1143
01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:49.940
Thank you.

1144
01:21:51.819 --> 01:21:54.488
Buy you a cup of coffee?
- Sure.

1145
01:21:54.947 --> 01:21:56.947
Black? Sugar? Milk?

1146
01:21:57.366 --> 01:21:59.406
You know. lt's all good.

1147
01:21:59.406 --> 01:22:01.535
You will get black.

1148
01:22:06.292 --> 01:22:08.292
Fresh pot.

1149
01:22:08.961 --> 01:22:10.363
You know Jack?

1150
01:22:10.363 --> 01:22:13.074
No. Not really.
He still on the job?

1151
01:22:13.074 --> 01:22:15.618
He does a little P.l. work now and then...

1152
01:22:15.618 --> 01:22:17.286
but he's mostly retired.

1153
01:22:17.286 --> 01:22:20.639
Living off his pension, huh?

1154
01:22:22.058 --> 01:22:25.002
Jack got caught up
in them Knapp hearings.

1155
01:22:25.002 --> 01:22:28.839
Set up by some dirty cops
who needed a fall guy.

1156
01:22:28.839 --> 01:22:32.218
Hurt him bad. Would have
broke his mother's heart.

1157
01:22:32.218 --> 01:22:33.427
ls she around?

1158
01:22:33.427 --> 01:22:35.012
Who?
- Your wife.

1159
01:22:35.012 --> 01:22:39.283
No. She passed on.
Long time ago.

1160
01:22:41.077 --> 01:22:44.705
Long time ago.

1161
01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:50.569
l am sorry.

1162
01:22:50.569 --> 01:22:52.669
That's OK.

1163
01:22:59.470 --> 01:23:01.806
Can l ask how she died?

1164
01:23:07.395 --> 01:23:09.647
Well, she...

1165
01:23:11.357 --> 01:23:13.859
she was murdered, Detective.

1166
01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:16.804
An ugly one,
to tell you the truth.

1167
01:23:16.804 --> 01:23:18.222
Mother of a cop...

1168
01:23:18.222 --> 01:23:21.977
and they never found the bastard who did it.

1169
01:23:56.068 --> 01:23:58.068
You on the job?

1170
01:24:02.158 --> 01:24:04.326
A long time ago.

1171
01:24:04.827 --> 01:24:06.145
Do l know you?

1172
01:24:06.145 --> 01:24:07.563
l look familiar?

1173
01:24:07.563 --> 01:24:09.315
What house you work?

1174
01:24:09.315 --> 01:24:10.775
The 7-4 Homicide.

1175
01:24:10.775 --> 01:24:12.875
A hotshot.

1176
01:24:13.335 --> 01:24:15.279
No, just...working the job.

1177
01:24:15.279 --> 01:24:16.822
Yeah, l hear that, pal.

1178
01:24:16.822 --> 01:24:18.282
As a matter of fact...

1179
01:24:18.282 --> 01:24:21.661
l caught a case that goes back to your day.

1180
01:24:21.661 --> 01:24:23.621
One of the Nightingale murders.

1181
01:24:23.621 --> 01:24:25.247
No kidding?

1182
01:24:25.247 --> 01:24:29.226
No. Missing teenager.
Disappeared back in '68.

1183
01:24:29.727 --> 01:24:31.587
They found her bones last week...

1184
01:24:31.587 --> 01:24:34.465
buried behind some diner
out by Dyckman Street.

1185
01:24:34.465 --> 01:24:36.384
Mary Finelli.

1186
01:24:36.384 --> 01:24:38.135
Yeah, talk about dumb luck.

1187
01:24:38.135 --> 01:24:40.471
The odds of anybody finding
that girl thirty years later...

1188
01:24:40.471 --> 01:24:43.099
and the chances of hitting a dental--

1189
01:24:43.099 --> 01:24:44.850
Forget about it.

1190
01:24:44.850 --> 01:24:47.103
The best part is,
she's the first victim.

1191
01:24:47.103 --> 01:24:49.747
And she knew the killer.
So...

1192
01:24:50.247 --> 01:24:55.092
l am betting those old bones
are going to do a lot of talking.

1193
01:24:56.754 --> 01:24:59.657
Not for nothing.
The past is a funny thing.

1194
01:24:59.657 --> 01:25:01.701
We all have skeletons in the closet.

1195
01:25:01.701 --> 01:25:05.246
You never know when they will
pop up and bite you in the ass.

1196
01:25:05.246 --> 01:25:07.390
Huh, Jack?

1197
01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:12.420
You changed your m.o.

1198
01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:14.922
because if they knew your mother
was a Nightingale...

1199
01:25:14.922 --> 01:25:16.882
they would have looked at the family.

1200
01:25:16.882 --> 01:25:19.443
They would have looked at you.

1201
01:25:24.782 --> 01:25:26.909
What are you looking at?

1202
01:25:27.410 --> 01:25:29.537
Stealing your life away.

1203
01:25:30.037 --> 01:25:32.565
You went down thirty years ago,
pal.

1204
01:25:32.565 --> 01:25:35.042
You just don't know it yet.

1205
01:26:01.235 --> 01:26:03.235
A cop? He's a cop?

1206
01:26:03.612 --> 01:26:05.598
What am l supposed to do with that?

1207
01:26:05.598 --> 01:26:07.642
Call the F.B.l.
Use a pay phone.

1208
01:26:07.642 --> 01:26:09.810
Don't give them your name, Dad.

1209
01:26:09.810 --> 01:26:13.230
Tell them Shepard killed Finelli
and Clark and the others...

1210
01:26:13.230 --> 01:26:14.482
that he's the Nightingale.

1211
01:26:14.482 --> 01:26:16.901
Then, tell them where Finelli's buried.

1212
01:26:16.901 --> 01:26:19.195
They will be able to connect him to her.

1213
01:26:19.195 --> 01:26:21.989
They search his place,
they will find some souvenirs.

1214
01:26:21.989 --> 01:26:26.424
He always took a piece of
jewellery from his victims.

1215
01:26:29.430 --> 01:26:31.958
What are you doing here?
Are you off today?

1216
01:26:31.958 --> 01:26:33.334
We need to have a conversation.

1217
01:26:33.334 --> 01:26:35.559
Dad?
- Hang on a sec, John.

1218
01:26:35.559 --> 01:26:39.090
l am kind of in the middle
of something important here.

1219
01:26:39.090 --> 01:26:41.884
Mind if we do this--
- l am sorry, Frank.

1220
01:26:41.884 --> 01:26:44.262
We need to step outside right now.

1221
01:26:44.262 --> 01:26:46.055
Dad, what's going on?

1222
01:26:46.055 --> 01:26:50.618
John, Satch is here,
and he's with his partner.

1223
01:26:51.118 --> 01:26:53.158
What the hell's going on?

1224
01:26:53.158 --> 01:26:54.438
Hang on a sec.

1225
01:26:54.438 --> 01:26:56.023
What's your partner doing here?

1226
01:26:56.023 --> 01:26:57.566
What happened to your eye?

1227
01:26:57.566 --> 01:26:59.277
l banged it up.

1228
01:26:59.277 --> 01:27:02.613
Let's go outside and talk.
We need to do that.

1229
01:27:02.613 --> 01:27:04.031
About what?

1230
01:27:04.031 --> 01:27:06.200
Let's go,
do us both a favour, huh?

1231
01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:08.300
All right.

1232
01:27:10.054 --> 01:27:13.114
Stay there, John.
l will be right back.

1233
01:27:15.142 --> 01:27:17.603
Be right back. All right?

1234
01:27:30.241 --> 01:27:32.961
Where were you last night,
Frank?

1235
01:27:34.495 --> 01:27:37.215
Where do you think l was, Satch?

1236
01:27:38.290 --> 01:27:40.290
Same place l found this.

1237
01:27:41.502 --> 01:27:44.052
Under the body of a dead woman.

1238
01:27:46.382 --> 01:27:49.760
No. This isn't what you think, OK?

1239
01:27:51.011 --> 01:27:52.496
This isn't what you think.

1240
01:27:52.496 --> 01:27:54.332
l want to be wrong here.

1241
01:27:54.332 --> 01:27:57.335
Let's take a ride to the precinct and talk.

1242
01:27:57.335 --> 01:27:59.920
l want to talk to you, too.
l need to talk to you.

1243
01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:01.464
Come on.
We will take a ride.

1244
01:28:01.464 --> 01:28:04.091
Let me just go inside,
tell my family where l am going.

1245
01:28:04.091 --> 01:28:06.402
All right?
Be right back.

1246
01:28:09.697 --> 01:28:12.587
Everything's all right.
Don't worry.

1247
01:28:18.205 --> 01:28:20.249
Chief, you there?

1248
01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:22.985
They found Sissy Clark.
They think l did it.

1249
01:28:22.985 --> 01:28:27.165
Just give me a second.
You have got to talk to Satch.

1250
01:28:28.257 --> 01:28:29.408
What's going on?

1251
01:28:29.408 --> 01:28:31.160
Uncle Satch, stop.

1252
01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:33.260
What's going on?

1253
01:29:04.335 --> 01:29:07.630
He's a cop.
- A cop?

1254
01:29:10.007 --> 01:29:12.007
Jack Shepard.

1255
01:29:12.007 --> 01:29:14.287
He's a detective at the 15th Precinct.

1256
01:29:14.287 --> 01:29:15.746
l swear, Satch.

1257
01:29:15.746 --> 01:29:19.250
And you got all of this
from the guy on the radio.

1258
01:29:19.250 --> 01:29:21.335
From your son in the future.

1259
01:29:21.335 --> 01:29:24.325
Yeah.
As nuts as that sounds, yeah.

1260
01:29:26.691 --> 01:29:30.761
You got to listen to me, Satch.
You got to open up your mind....

1261
01:29:30.761 --> 01:29:32.847
You got to understand what l am saying.

1262
01:29:32.847 --> 01:29:34.890
You got something going on with this girl...

1263
01:29:34.890 --> 01:29:36.183
that's one thing.

1264
01:29:36.183 --> 01:29:38.786
But you got to tell me.

1265
01:29:40.746 --> 01:29:43.941
Are you listening to me?
You're in a world of shit.

1266
01:29:43.941 --> 01:29:47.403
An eyewitness put you outside
the dead girl's apartment.

1267
01:29:47.403 --> 01:29:49.238
Your prints are all over the place...

1268
01:29:49.238 --> 01:29:51.532
not to mention
the goddamn driver's licence.

1269
01:29:51.532 --> 01:29:54.327
Chuck is getting
a search warrant for your house.

1270
01:29:54.327 --> 01:29:56.954
What's he going to find there?
- Nothing.

1271
01:29:56.954 --> 01:30:01.474
You got to give me something,
something l can believe.

1272
01:30:11.736 --> 01:30:14.201
What if l can prove it to you?

1273
01:30:14.201 --> 01:30:15.473
How's that?

1274
01:30:15.473 --> 01:30:17.850
World Series.
Where are they right now?

1275
01:30:17.850 --> 01:30:20.245
What, fourth, fifth inning?

1276
01:30:20.661 --> 01:30:23.041
What if l was to tell you...

1277
01:30:23.289 --> 01:30:25.816
that in the bottom of the sixth inning...

1278
01:30:25.816 --> 01:30:28.444
the Mets are going to be down three-zip?

1279
01:30:28.444 --> 01:30:30.905
And Cleon Jones,
he's going to come to bat.

1280
01:30:30.905 --> 01:30:35.760
He's going to get hit in the foot
by a wild pitch.

1281
01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:38.996
And it's going to leave
a shoe polish mark on the ball.

1282
01:30:38.996 --> 01:30:41.098
Hear me out, all right?

1283
01:30:41.599 --> 01:30:44.659
He goes to first.
Clendendon comes up.

1284
01:30:44.659 --> 01:30:48.047
He's going to hit a two-two pitch
into the left-field bleachers.

1285
01:30:48.047 --> 01:30:49.382
This is insane, Frank.

1286
01:30:49.382 --> 01:30:53.135
ln the bottom of the seventh,
Weis hits a solo home run.....

1287
01:30:53.135 --> 01:30:55.930
and then Jones and Swoboda
score in the eighth.

1288
01:30:55.930 --> 01:30:58.266
The Mets, they're going to win,
five to three.

1289
01:30:58.266 --> 01:31:00.393
Go watch.
lf it don't happen, l am a liar.

1290
01:31:00.393 --> 01:31:02.270
Watch the game?

1291
01:31:02.270 --> 01:31:04.188
Watch the game.

1292
01:31:04.188 --> 01:31:07.441
Frank, they're going to make you
for Sissy Clark's murder.

1293
01:31:07.441 --> 01:31:10.945
And they're going to match that
with the Nightingale murders.

1294
01:31:10.945 --> 01:31:14.048
Do you understand what that means?

1295
01:31:15.466 --> 01:31:18.951
His wife is here.
She wants to talk to you.

1296
01:31:57.925 --> 01:32:02.221
One-two pitch to Anderson.
Fly ball to right.

1297
01:32:02.722 --> 01:32:05.952
Let's walk, Jules.
Get a cup of coffee.

1298
01:32:10.479 --> 01:32:13.049
The guy went crazy.
Know what l mean?

1299
01:32:13.049 --> 01:32:16.193
Started tearing things apart.

1300
01:32:16.694 --> 01:32:18.738
Throwing things.

1301
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.860
How you doing?

1302
01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:37.295
You got a collar in here
for the Nightingale murders?

1303
01:32:48.517 --> 01:32:52.855
Everything OK with you and Frank?

1304
01:32:53.355 --> 01:32:57.426
Yeah, we're good. He works hard.
l work hard. We're good.

1305
01:32:57.426 --> 01:32:59.651
Who's Sissy Clark, Satch?

1306
01:33:03.908 --> 01:33:07.138
Do you know where Frank was last night?

1307
01:33:07.138 --> 01:33:10.206
Yeah. He was working.
He had a tour.

1308
01:33:37.191 --> 01:33:39.276
Sit down.

1309
01:33:41.987 --> 01:33:44.452
Did you just hear what l said?

1310
01:33:56.460 --> 01:33:58.460
So how'd you know?

1311
01:34:00.464 --> 01:34:03.117
How you doing?
- What's up in here?

1312
01:34:03.117 --> 01:34:04.660
Shut up, asshole.

1313
01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:07.565
He tried to kill me.
Go find Satch.

1314
01:34:07.805 --> 01:34:10.933
Find Satch.
He's trying to kill me.

1315
01:34:13.894 --> 01:34:16.784
What are you doing with my collar?

1316
01:34:18.149 --> 01:34:21.469
Sorry, pal. l didn't mean
to step on your toes.

1317
01:34:21.469 --> 01:34:23.054
They sent me up from downstairs.

1318
01:34:23.054 --> 01:34:24.722
l thought you'd be in there with him.

1319
01:34:24.722 --> 01:34:26.933
What are you looking at him for?

1320
01:34:26.933 --> 01:34:31.453
He matches a description
of an armed-robbery suspect.

1321
01:34:31.871 --> 01:34:34.081
So tell me about the radio.

1322
01:34:34.081 --> 01:34:36.192
Who's he talking to on that thing?

1323
01:34:36.192 --> 01:34:38.292
John. He's a cop.

1324
01:34:38.544 --> 01:34:41.489
He talks to him all the time.
l have talked to him, too.

1325
01:34:41.489 --> 01:34:44.550
You talked to Johnny on the radio?

1326
01:34:46.010 --> 01:34:47.870
John. What's going on, Satch?

1327
01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:49.664
You come into my house,
take Frank...

1328
01:34:49.664 --> 01:34:53.164
and now you're talking to me like a cop.

1329
01:34:54.810 --> 01:34:57.129
l am talking to you as a friend.

1330
01:34:57.129 --> 01:35:01.192
because as a cop,
l wouldn't be here at all.

1331
01:35:04.195 --> 01:35:08.445
Listen, Jules, they're going to
take me off this case.

1332
01:35:08.783 --> 01:35:13.458
Then Frank is going to tell them
what he's been telling me.

1333
01:35:14.455 --> 01:35:18.535
And then nobody is going to
be able to help him. OK?

1334
01:35:18.876 --> 01:35:22.701
...left field, and Cleon Jones
makes the catch.

1335
01:35:23.506 --> 01:35:25.992
Half the uniforms are either
at the game or on the street.

1336
01:35:25.992 --> 01:35:27.994
lt's going to be a riot if they pull it off.

1337
01:35:27.994 --> 01:35:30.596
What is he telling us, Satch?

1338
01:35:31.097 --> 01:35:34.582
That he's talking to Johnny on the radio.

1339
01:35:35.017 --> 01:35:37.545
Yeah. John the cop.
l told you that.

1340
01:35:37.545 --> 01:35:43.067
No. He says that John is your son, Johnny.

1341
01:35:43.567 --> 01:35:46.967
Little Johnny on the radio in the future.

1342
01:35:47.279 --> 01:35:49.279
On the radio. You see?

1343
01:35:51.867 --> 01:35:54.954
No. You misunderstood him.

1344
01:36:10.344 --> 01:36:12.888
Jules? Sissy Clark?

1345
01:36:14.682 --> 01:36:18.644
She's a nurse,
and she was murdered yesterday.

1346
01:36:20.688 --> 01:36:22.548
And Frank is connected.

1347
01:36:22.548 --> 01:36:24.634
He is either a material witness...

1348
01:36:24.634 --> 01:36:27.709
or an accomplice or the perpetrator.

1349
01:36:32.116 --> 01:36:35.856
...McNally, who's been
thoroughly in command.

1350
01:36:41.208 --> 01:36:46.088
Cleon starts down to first base,
and DeMiro calls him back.

1351
01:36:49.467 --> 01:36:54.057
Satch, you know him. You know
he didn't do this, right?

1352
01:36:55.181 --> 01:36:57.166
Hodges showing the baseball to DeMiro.

1353
01:36:57.166 --> 01:36:58.668
Can l see him?

1354
01:36:58.668 --> 01:37:01.212
Hodges--We might have
a shoe polish play here.

1355
01:37:01.212 --> 01:37:03.714
Remember the Nippy Jones
shoe polish play...

1356
01:37:03.714 --> 01:37:07.044
in the 1957 World Series at Milwaukee?

1357
01:37:07.318 --> 01:37:11.738
Hodges showing it to Lou DeMiro,
who awards first base.

1358
01:37:14.909 --> 01:37:16.909
My God.

1359
01:37:17.995 --> 01:37:19.995
Satch, what's going on?

1360
01:37:19.995 --> 01:37:23.067
Mind if l go back at the fireboy for a while?

1361
01:37:23.067 --> 01:37:24.902
l just want to see what he's got.

1362
01:37:24.902 --> 01:37:25.622
Jesus.

1363
01:38:40.995 --> 01:38:42.995
Way back in leftfield.

1364
01:43:57.478 --> 01:43:59.522
Hey, bud.

1365
01:44:19.959 --> 01:44:22.278
See if aviation's got a helicopter.

1366
01:44:22.278 --> 01:44:24.822
Respond to my location
for commencing an air search...

1367
01:44:24.822 --> 01:44:27.633
for body in water, OK?

1368
01:44:53.784 --> 01:44:56.562
lt was a season and World Series
for the ages...

1369
01:44:56.562 --> 01:45:00.900
for the Mets and Series M.V.P.
first baseman Donn Clendendon.

1370
01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:04.570
For the Mets faithful,
the New York fans--Wow.

1371
01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:06.906
With the streets of midtown
and Times Square...

1372
01:45:06.906 --> 01:45:10.066
still packed with celebrating fans...

1373
01:45:20.269 --> 01:45:23.584
Here's your coffee and your cigarettes.

1374
01:45:25.983 --> 01:45:28.448
ln the skies over New York...

1375
01:45:28.819 --> 01:45:31.222
another amazing event
is coming to a close.

1376
01:45:31.222 --> 01:45:33.599
lt's time to say goodbye
to the northern lights...

1377
01:45:33.599 --> 01:45:34.850
l will be upstairs.

1378
01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:37.812
...that have been lighting up the skies.

1379
01:45:37.812 --> 01:45:39.814
Astronomists say
the incredible sun storms...

1380
01:45:39.814 --> 01:45:42.233
that have created the remarkable
aurora borealis...

1381
01:45:42.233 --> 01:45:43.943
have begun to cool...

1382
01:45:43.943 --> 01:45:46.112
and the auroras,
already dimming...

1383
01:45:46.112 --> 01:45:48.252
will be over by morning.

1384
01:46:24.875 --> 01:46:26.875
John, are you there?

1385
01:46:26.875 --> 01:46:28.529
John, l am back.

1386
01:46:28.529 --> 01:46:30.281
John, are you there?

1387
01:46:30.281 --> 01:46:32.381
l am here, Dad.

1388
01:46:32.842 --> 01:46:34.842
We did it, son.
- What?

1389
01:46:34.842 --> 01:46:36.844
We stopped him.
- We did?

1390
01:46:37.888 --> 01:46:40.808
Something's wrong.
l don't re--

1391
01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:44.560
What? What's wrong?

1392
01:46:44.895 --> 01:46:48.040
lf we stopped him,
why isn't Mom here?

1393
01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:51.277
Why don't l remember her being OK?

1394
01:46:51.777 --> 01:46:55.156
But...l killed him.
He's dead.

1395
01:47:01.203 --> 01:47:04.832
My turn to steal your life away.

1396
01:47:05.332 --> 01:47:07.332
John, are you there?

1397
01:47:48.959 --> 01:47:50.959
Hey, bud.

1398
01:48:12.233 --> 01:48:12.953
Julia?

1399
01:48:33.421 --> 01:48:34.905
Oh, Julia.

1400
01:48:34.905 --> 01:48:35.625
Mommy?

1401
01:48:58.988 --> 01:49:03.159
Hey. lt's OK.
lt's OK, you little rascal.

1402
01:49:05.911 --> 01:49:08.272
What are you going to do, Frank?

1403
01:49:08.272 --> 01:49:09.941
Put the gun down.

1404
01:49:09.941 --> 01:49:11.192
Let him go.

1405
01:49:11.192 --> 01:49:13.961
Well, put the gun down.

1406
01:49:18.716 --> 01:49:22.031
l will snap his neck.
Put the gun down now.

1407
01:49:34.482 --> 01:49:38.402
Time to die, Sullivan.

1408
01:49:40.112 --> 01:49:42.112
Run, Johnny. Run.

1409
01:50:00.007 --> 01:50:02.093
Come here.
You all right?

1410
01:50:02.593 --> 01:50:04.593
You all right?

1411
01:50:53.310 --> 01:50:55.312
l am still here, Chief.

1412
01:51:23.382 --> 01:51:25.426
l got it. Mine.

1413
01:51:31.557 --> 01:51:33.376
Come on, Johnny.

1414
01:51:33.376 --> 01:51:36.854
Round the horn.

1415
01:51:39.774 --> 01:51:41.774
OK. Come on, Frank.

1416
01:51:43.486 --> 01:51:45.680
Come on.
No batter, no batter, no batter.

1417
01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:48.115
Come on, Frank. Yes.

1418
01:51:49.825 --> 01:51:52.745
The Benz. Not the Benz.

1419
01:51:53.245 --> 01:51:57.124
No. God, not the Benz.

1420
01:51:58.501 --> 01:52:00.836
Oh, my God.

1421
01:52:02.171 --> 01:52:04.171
Nice hit, Frank.

1422
01:52:04.465 --> 01:52:06.465
Way to go.

1423
01:52:06.465 --> 01:52:08.550
Thank you very much.

1424
01:52:11.180 --> 01:52:13.624
Let's play some ball.
- You will pay for that.

1425
01:52:13.624 --> 01:52:17.124
Come on.
No batter, no batter, no batter.

1426
01:52:17.978 --> 01:52:21.065
Go get it.
He's slow, he's old.

1427
01:52:26.862 --> 01:52:28.989
Bring me home, Chief.
