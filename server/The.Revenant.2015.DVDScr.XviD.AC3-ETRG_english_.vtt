2
00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.846
It's okay, son...

3
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.357
I know you want this to be over.

4
00:01:21.026 --> 00:01:23.105
I'm right here.

5
00:01:27.516 --> 00:01:29.496
I will be right here...

6
00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:40.108
But, you don't give up.

7
00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:44.090
You hear me?

8
00:01:47.788 --> 00:01:52.652
As long as you can still grab
a breath, you fight.

9
00:01:54.468 --> 00:01:56.535
You breathe... keep breathing.

10
00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:45.808
Hawk.

11
00:04:12.613 --> 00:04:13.950
Calm.

12
00:04:32.494 --> 00:04:33.990
Oh shit!

13
00:04:35.848 --> 00:04:38.606
God damn sons of bitches.

14
00:04:40.742 --> 00:04:42.859
God shit me more.

15
00:04:48.947 --> 00:04:50.939
- Hey you seen Coulter?
- No.

16
00:04:54.401 --> 00:04:57.215
Listen up! When them pelts is clean...

17
00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.042
I want you to wrap 'em up real tight.

18
00:04:59.758 --> 00:05:03.542
Remember, We're not doin' no
15 pelt bales...

19
00:05:03.566 --> 00:05:05.714
- We're doin' 30 pelt bales.
- Fitzgerald.

20
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.073
- Captain.
- Where are we with the haul?

21
00:05:09.628 --> 00:05:10.687
What are you thinking?

22
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.859
Well...

23
00:05:12.208 --> 00:05:14.882
I'm thinkin' whatever it is that
they're hunting out there...

24
00:05:14.907 --> 00:05:16.950
I'm hoping they don't need another shot.

25
00:05:16.974 --> 00:05:18.857
Let's make sure we're at ahead by dawn.

26
00:05:18.992 --> 00:05:20.315
We've been done by this morning.

27
00:05:20.488 --> 00:05:22.143
I don't like to be not here myself by now,
but you know we're not.

28
00:05:22.167 --> 00:05:23.705
We men are too tired.

29
00:05:23.836 --> 00:05:26.244
I figure we're only few days out from
the Fort, we're trapped out.

30
00:05:26.268 --> 00:05:27.628
All we have to worry about...

31
00:05:27.652 --> 00:05:29.114
- is getting some fresh meat for the boys.
- Yeah.

32
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.379
Yeah, you seen Coulter?

33
00:05:35.687 --> 00:05:36.975
- Hey, we took down an elk.

34
00:05:37.445 --> 00:05:38.393
A big one.

35
00:05:39.661 --> 00:05:41.147
We're gonna need some help
to haul the meat back.

36
00:05:41.207 --> 00:05:43.063
You let me know when it's on the spit.

37
00:05:43.184 --> 00:05:44.350
- I'll help with it then.

38
00:05:44.434 --> 00:05:45.941
Hey no, come on fellas... I need your help.

39
00:05:45.988 --> 00:05:48.709
We needed help when we were bustin'
are asses loadin' them bales.

40
00:05:48.722 --> 00:05:51.617
I've been out here so long eating
this damn beaver meat...

41
00:05:51.914 --> 00:05:53.942
I'm actually starting to
miss my wife's cooking.

42
00:05:53.966 --> 00:05:56.008
Shit, I'm actually startin'
to miss your wife.

43
00:05:56.027 --> 00:05:57.268
Why don't you shut the hell?...

44
00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.255
- Help.

45
00:06:00.517 --> 00:06:01.670
- Is that Coulter?

46
00:06:02.221 --> 00:06:04.086
- Stay together.
- Jim, you go get the Captain.

47
00:06:04.476 --> 00:06:05.750
Jesus Christ!

48
00:06:05.785 --> 00:06:07.249
- Shut up!
- Help him!

49
00:06:09.608 --> 00:06:12.454
- Anybody seeing them?
- Stay quiet dammit...

50
00:06:17.937 --> 00:06:18.736
God damn.

51
00:06:25.021 --> 00:06:26.088
What was that?

52
00:06:32.708 --> 00:06:34.066
Pa?

53
00:06:34.329 --> 00:06:35.208
Let's go.

54
00:06:57.175 --> 00:06:58.499
They got Thomas.

55
00:07:21.892 --> 00:07:24.489
I can't see 'em.

56
00:07:29.763 --> 00:07:31.509
- Get down.
- Oh shit.

57
00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:32.516
They are everywhere.

58
00:07:32.686 --> 00:07:33.415
We are surrounded.

59
00:07:33.555 --> 00:07:35.863
- They're everywhere.
- Soho...

60
00:07:35.868 --> 00:07:37.361
Stay here.

61
00:07:38.182 --> 00:07:39.545
No, no. Oh no!

62
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:44.382
Stay down. - Help me!

63
00:07:48.208 --> 00:07:49.625
They want us out in the open...

64
00:07:49.721 --> 00:07:51.042
Someone get up the hill!

65
00:07:51.166 --> 00:07:53.637
Nobody move, just stay where you are.

66
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.211
Well they want the pelts.

67
00:07:55.773 --> 00:07:57.916
We go and get on them 'bout right now...

68
00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.048
or we gonna lose it all.

69
00:08:16.654 --> 00:08:19.172
Get to the boat. To the boat, son.

70
00:08:19.385 --> 00:08:21.674
Move, move, move.

71
00:08:25.221 --> 00:08:28.225
Leave the forest, leave the forest...

72
00:08:28.249 --> 00:08:29.383
To the boat.

73
00:08:54.029 --> 00:08:55.974
Hawk!

74
00:09:02.287 --> 00:09:05.640
Hawk, Hawk!

75
00:09:33.916 --> 00:09:35.364
Grab some pelts!

76
00:09:35.843 --> 00:09:37.333
Come on, grab the pelt!

77
00:09:56.833 --> 00:09:58.371
Grab the pelt.

78
00:09:58.744 --> 00:10:00.077
Come on.

79
00:10:01.462 --> 00:10:02.269
Come on.

80
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.061
Get this to my little girl.
You're coming with us I'm gettin' help...

81
00:10:34.006 --> 00:10:35.308
Lean on me, just get...

82
00:10:38.814 --> 00:10:39.812
Glass!

83
00:10:39.836 --> 00:10:41.060
Get to the boat!

84
00:11:03.512 --> 00:11:04.533
You fuckin' son of a...

85
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:08.294
Get on the fuckin' boat.

86
00:11:18.217 --> 00:11:19.122
Help.

87
00:11:23.171 --> 00:11:25.537
Move, come on.

88
00:11:29.238 --> 00:11:30.238
Come on.

89
00:11:31.142 --> 00:11:32.831
- Cut the rope.

90
00:11:33.414 --> 00:11:34.213
- Cut the rope.
- Wait for Amos, wait for Amos...

91
00:11:35.517 --> 00:11:37.137
We go now.

92
00:11:37.621 --> 00:11:39.305
Go to the cannon.

93
00:11:50.025 --> 00:11:52.350
Don't leave, please.

94
00:12:38.468 --> 00:12:40.473
My daughter, Powaqa, is not here.

95
00:12:41.534 --> 00:12:43.104
Collect all the pelts we can carry.

96
00:12:43.747 --> 00:12:47.915
We'll trade pelts with French for horses

97
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:49.957
and we will keep searching for her.

98
00:12:54.018 --> 00:12:55.623
And the dust becomes flower...

99
00:12:55.658 --> 00:12:56.585
Amen.

100
00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:58.423
When the morning was clear...

101
00:13:01.957 --> 00:13:04.460
Amen.

102
00:13:17.698 --> 00:13:18.625
Ready?

103
00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:21.689
Hold still.

104
00:13:27.243 --> 00:13:29.215
Where did you learn that?

105
00:13:29.567 --> 00:13:31.291
My father was a doctor.

106
00:13:31.391 --> 00:13:34.571
- Bridger.
- Captain we got a small tree niggers out here...

107
00:13:34.595 --> 00:13:36.037
Waiting to finish the job.

108
00:13:36.199 --> 00:13:37.326
- Hold there.
- Yes.

109
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:41.859
Tell me you got some kind of plan.

110
00:13:47.317 --> 00:13:48.522
Glass.

111
00:13:49.666 --> 00:13:51.390
Missouri is no good.

112
00:13:52.083 --> 00:13:53.900
Not while the Rees runnin' it.

113
00:13:54.969 --> 00:13:56.586
We got to get off this boat...

114
00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:58.236
Oh you want to get off the boat?

115
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:01.677
Then what we're gonna do, hah?

116
00:14:02.333 --> 00:14:03.787
We're gonna take our furs...

117
00:14:03.811 --> 00:14:06.376
And sit out there amongst the Ree,
like a bunch of god damn ducks.

118
00:14:06.709 --> 00:14:09.142
Only safe thing to do is track a new course

119
00:14:09.166 --> 00:14:10.277
back upon land.

120
00:14:10.521 --> 00:14:11.591
We'll add weeks to the trip.

121
00:14:11.721 --> 00:14:13.871
Better then floating back down there where
they can get their eyes on us.

122
00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:16.109
They got eyes on you right now, son.

123
00:14:17.705 --> 00:14:20.045
What I'm saying is we stay on the boat.

124
00:14:20.696 --> 00:14:22.761
Try the course toward the Fort...

125
00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.639
We take the chances on the water.

126
00:14:24.663 --> 00:14:27.384
Glass knows this territory better than
the rest of us put together.

127
00:14:27.434 --> 00:14:29.192
It's his job to get us home safe.

128
00:14:29.216 --> 00:14:30.572
- Get us home safe?
- Yeah.

129
00:14:30.589 --> 00:14:33.036
- Need I remind you we already lost 32 men?

130
00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:33.987
- 33 now.

131
00:14:34.238 --> 00:14:36.481
They were my men Fitzgerald,
I know how many I lost.

132
00:14:38.035 --> 00:14:40.028
We do like Glass says,
that's the end of it.

133
00:14:54.166 --> 00:14:56.165
We have to set the boat loose.

134
00:14:56.189 --> 00:14:58.466
If Ree are tracking us, they will find it
down the river.

135
00:14:58.501 --> 00:15:00.744
The best course is hike in on the ground
and follow it down...

136
00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.481
to Fort Kahowa.

137
00:15:02.547 --> 00:15:03.638
- What, on foot?
- Are you sure?

138
00:15:04.056 --> 00:15:05.805
It'd be a week before we get there.

139
00:15:06.137 --> 00:15:08.353
Unless we come across a poach straying
prison horses.

140
00:15:08.377 --> 00:15:09.908
Ain't no poach that far over.

141
00:15:09.937 --> 00:15:11.384
Right, Captain.

142
00:15:11.507 --> 00:15:13.900
Losing this boat is god damn stinking.

143
00:15:13.941 --> 00:15:15.989
Besides the Rees ain't that stupid...

144
00:15:16.063 --> 00:15:18.793
If we keep it, we can lay
it up around hours peak.

145
00:15:18.817 --> 00:15:20.879
Quit acting like you know what you're
talking about Fitzgerald.

146
00:15:20.903 --> 00:15:22.076
Ain't nobody talking to you.

147
00:15:22.512 --> 00:15:24.031
Who'd listen to you anyway.

148
00:15:24.232 --> 00:15:27.565
God damn, can't even ...find fuckin...
potato shit...

149
00:15:27.589 --> 00:15:28.459
All I'm sayin' is...

150
00:15:28.823 --> 00:15:30.720
camp Roollin is just up away...

151
00:15:31.045 --> 00:15:32.392
And we can hold up there.

152
00:15:33.503 --> 00:15:34.536
We walk.

153
00:15:35.548 --> 00:15:37.120
Yeah, I'm sure we will.

154
00:15:38.483 --> 00:15:42.522
God damn, wish my daddy was a doctor then
he could have bought me a captains job.

155
00:15:42.634 --> 00:15:43.988
So what do we do now?

156
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:46.956
Praying that poach ain't rockin'
if we ever get back here...

157
00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.966
- to pick them up.
- Make sure to mark this place.

158
00:15:49.386 --> 00:15:51.314
We're leaving a fortune under these rocks.

159
00:15:51.338 --> 00:15:53.490
No more room here, you
gotta move up the hill.

160
00:15:53.514 --> 00:15:55.538
- Glass. Chart a course...

161
00:15:55.562 --> 00:15:57.880
Try as you can figure to
get us around the reef.

162
00:15:57.904 --> 00:15:58.825
- Yes sir.

163
00:15:59.872 --> 00:16:03.769
- This ain't right, this ain't right.

164
00:16:04.015 --> 00:16:07.538
We all know that this furs ain't won't
be here by the time we come back.

165
00:16:07.562 --> 00:16:09.359
There is no way we can hold
them all the way back...

166
00:16:09.383 --> 00:16:10.261
to the Fort.

167
00:16:10.391 --> 00:16:12.309
Not the way we're going, besides Arikara is

168
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.715
spread all through their territory,
we want to go with our hands free.

169
00:16:14.739 --> 00:16:16.493
I'm tryin' to tell you're gonna
lose this pelts.

170
00:16:16.517 --> 00:16:18.290
- Would you rather hold on to the pelts
or your life?

171
00:16:18.314 --> 00:16:19.224
Life?

172
00:16:19.552 --> 00:16:22.038
What life you talking about?
I ain't got no life.

173
00:16:22.425 --> 00:16:25.625
I just got livin' the only way I get
to do that is through this pelts.

174
00:16:27.624 --> 00:16:28.506
Fuck!

175
00:16:29.039 --> 00:16:30.341
Calm there Fitz.

176
00:16:31.475 --> 00:16:33.811
Make a way, I'm going home...

177
00:16:33.835 --> 00:16:36.519
After six months working my ass
of like a mule,

178
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:38.250
risking my neck...

179
00:16:38.274 --> 00:16:40.015
Men dying and for what?

180
00:16:40.149 --> 00:16:41.700
Damn nearly lost everything.

181
00:16:41.748 --> 00:16:43.439
This job's been fucked from the start.

182
00:16:44.823 --> 00:16:46.454
There is the one being fuckin' us.

183
00:16:47.524 --> 00:16:50.866
Any of you boys wonder how Ree managed
to get their drop on us

184
00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:52.031
for Mr. Glass here,

185
00:16:52.066 --> 00:16:54.208
was supposed to be looking out for
that fucking thing.

186
00:16:54.232 --> 00:16:58.509
All them Pawnee buddies of his. - Pawnees
as much against Rees as the rest of us.

187
00:16:59.319 --> 00:17:00.397
Yeah?

188
00:17:00.967 --> 00:17:02.424
What about his little...

189
00:17:02.796 --> 00:17:04.213
half-breed son?

190
00:17:05.128 --> 00:17:07.519
And what kind of savage you think
his momma was.

191
00:17:07.543 --> 00:17:08.971
Lay of the boy Fitz.

192
00:17:10.007 --> 00:17:11.458
All I'm saying here.

193
00:17:12.002 --> 00:17:14.589
Savage is savage...

194
00:17:22.653 --> 00:17:23.865
Hey Glass.

195
00:17:25.588 --> 00:17:28.470
Is it true what they say?
That you shootin' a lieutenant...

196
00:17:28.494 --> 00:17:30.214
While you was living with them savages?

197
00:17:30.238 --> 00:17:31.319
Fitzgerald.

198
00:17:34.088 --> 00:17:37.360
21 dead soldiers, more than
40 dead feather necks...

199
00:17:37.395 --> 00:17:39.474
But you and your boy are the only ones
to get walk out alive.

200
00:17:39.498 --> 00:17:41.491
It was kind of a miracle, don't you think?

201
00:17:41.515 --> 00:17:42.974
You need to shut up Fitzgerald.

202
00:17:44.885 --> 00:17:46.151
Is that what you did?

203
00:17:46.304 --> 00:17:48.766
Shot one of your own to save this little
dog right here?

204
00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:50.313
- Shut up.
- You want to fight son?

205
00:17:50.479 --> 00:17:52.821
You were playing with
this little boy's momma?

206
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.887
- Fitzgerald!
- Need to kill her?

207
00:17:56.206 --> 00:17:58.730
Hey you can quit polishing that rifle,
while I'm talking to you.

208
00:17:59.636 --> 00:18:00.738
I'm working on it.

209
00:18:00.976 --> 00:18:03.562
You can work on it later
when I'm done talking to you.

210
00:18:04.001 --> 00:18:05.987
- Look at me scalp.
- That's enough!

211
00:18:07.611 --> 00:18:09.352
You're forgettin' your place boy.

212
00:18:11.153 --> 00:18:14.954
As far as I can tell my place is right
here, on the smart end of this rifle.

213
00:18:15.492 --> 00:18:17.055
You move along Fitzgerald.

214
00:18:19.138 --> 00:18:20.278
That's an order.

215
00:18:20.876 --> 00:18:21.842
Listen to me.

216
00:18:22.115 --> 00:18:23.995
We only have a couple hours of light left.

217
00:18:24.019 --> 00:18:25.123
We gotta stash these pelts...

218
00:18:25.147 --> 00:18:26.664
And get rid of the boat, let's go.

219
00:18:26.854 --> 00:18:27.906
Yes, Captain.

220
00:18:29.862 --> 00:18:32.291
I told you to be invisible, son.

221
00:18:32.315 --> 00:18:34.186
- At least...
- If you want to survive keep your...

222
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:34.930
mouth shut.

223
00:18:35.302 --> 00:18:40.709
- At least he heard me...
- They don't hear your voice!

224
00:18:40.733 --> 00:18:42.803
They just see the color of your face.

225
00:18:43.704 --> 00:18:44.862
You understand?

226
00:18:45.556 --> 00:18:47.234
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

227
00:18:52.357 --> 00:18:54.080
You have to listen to me, son.

228
00:18:54.888 --> 00:18:56.383
You have to listen.

229
00:19:09.671 --> 00:19:10.892
Beckett.

230
00:19:12.293 --> 00:19:13.462
Weston.

231
00:19:13.904 --> 00:19:15.181
Why are they not jumping?

232
00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:17.838
It looks like they changed their minds.

233
00:19:24.391 --> 00:19:25.893
Smart sons of bitches.

234
00:19:26.974 --> 00:19:28.158
Smart...

235
00:19:34.691 --> 00:19:36.626
I ought to be on that boat.

236
00:19:40.423 --> 00:19:41.930
You did the right thing.

237
00:19:59.045 --> 00:20:00.312
It's time to move.

238
00:20:01.282 --> 00:20:02.501
Get up.

239
00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:04.780
We're headed out.

240
00:20:07.802 --> 00:20:09.106
I'm coming.

241
00:20:12.266 --> 00:20:14.368
It's better you lay down.

242
00:20:16.635 --> 00:20:18.752
When the rest of the
men are ready you send them to me.

243
00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:21.355
I'm going West.

244
00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.418
You are my son.

245
00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:41.580
You are my son.

246
00:20:51.859 --> 00:20:55.478
There are only two here.

247
00:20:55.502 --> 00:20:57.178
Powaqa is not here.

248
00:20:59.518 --> 00:21:01.804
The others probably took her.

249
00:21:02.011 --> 00:21:04.548
They went north.

250
00:21:05.337 --> 00:21:09.777
We'll pick up their tracks
on the mountain.

251
00:21:17.525 --> 00:21:19.192
Was it the right decision...

252
00:21:19.298 --> 00:21:20.605
Leaving the boat?

253
00:21:21.363 --> 00:21:23.169
Ree own that river.

254
00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.168
Would have flanked us.

255
00:21:25.724 --> 00:21:28.092
If we stay east to the ground
to those mountains...

256
00:21:28.116 --> 00:21:30.005
We cut a week of our trip.

257
00:21:30.029 --> 00:21:32.351
Land is all dry up there,
nothing for the Ree to hunt.

258
00:21:33.919 --> 00:21:37.239
- Except us?
- Except us.

259
00:21:44.167 --> 00:21:45.839
Is it true what Fitzgerald said?

260
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:49.879
Is that why you came out here
to the edge of the world?

261
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:55.836
Glass?
I didn't like the quiet.

262
00:21:58.283 --> 00:22:01.179
Your boy, he's seen a lot...

263
00:22:02.312 --> 00:22:04.726
He got a mother you need
to get him back to?

264
00:29:07.181 --> 00:29:08.686
Glass!?
Hey there are cubs here.

265
00:29:08.721 --> 00:29:09.757
¡Glass!

266
00:29:12.483 --> 00:29:13.647
We got cubs here.

267
00:29:18.219 --> 00:29:19.529
Christ almighty.

268
00:29:20.933 --> 00:29:22.201
Hey you.

269
00:29:23.002 --> 00:29:23.938
Hey!

270
00:29:24.027 --> 00:29:25.593
He's down here.

271
00:29:27.609 --> 00:29:29.168
- Help me out...
- Keep your eyes open, the bear's alive.

272
00:29:29.497 --> 00:29:31.072
Come on, I need your help now.

273
00:29:33.279 --> 00:29:34.176
Glass.

274
00:29:34.942 --> 00:29:35.968
Oh my god!

275
00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:39.349
- Oh Christ!
- Captain.

276
00:29:39.693 --> 00:29:40.549
Give me rags now!

277
00:29:41.376 --> 00:29:42.771
Push where he bleeds out.

278
00:29:44.959 --> 00:29:45.995
Prepare the kit.

279
00:29:46.461 --> 00:29:48.212
Bridger, you hold that.

280
00:29:49.349 --> 00:29:50.834
- Easy.
- Oh God!

281
00:29:51.253 --> 00:29:53.936
- Gotta give him credit for taking
that Grizz down with him.

282
00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.886
He shouldn't have fire the shot, the whole
place is crawling with fucking tree niggers...

283
00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:00.097
- Hey that's enough, that's enough!

284
00:30:00.336 --> 00:30:01.679
- We're still on Ree territory here...

285
00:30:01.773 --> 00:30:03.642
This is one of our own men, god dammit.

286
00:30:04.495 --> 00:30:07.174
- The boy leave him, just
got a circle around us.

287
00:30:07.198 --> 00:30:09.071
North and west, take those two with you.

288
00:30:09.106 --> 00:30:11.294
Bill, Fryman you take South and East.

289
00:30:11.518 --> 00:30:13.588
Watch for anyone that might
have heard that shot.

290
00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.601
- Yes sir.
- We have to stitch him up.

291
00:30:16.381 --> 00:30:17.106
What about me?

292
00:30:18.013 --> 00:30:19.069
It's alright.

293
00:30:19.141 --> 00:30:20.353
You have to... - You stay here.

294
00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.959
- Hold it down.
- I'm sorry Mr. Glass. I am so sorry.

295
00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:26.178
- Bridger, hold him. Press down here.

296
00:30:27.551 --> 00:30:28.761
He is bleeding down here too.

297
00:30:30.412 --> 00:30:31.967
Torturing the bastard.

298
00:30:32.676 --> 00:30:36.595
The proper thing to do would be though...
Finish him off quick.

299
00:30:37.498 --> 00:30:39.594
Unless he has a chance of pulling through.

300
00:30:42.044 --> 00:30:45.792
Pullin' thru? You saw what
that Grizz did to him.

301
00:30:46.192 --> 00:30:47.813
He'll be dead inside an hour.

302
00:30:49.758 --> 00:30:52.855
Yeah, we all will be if we don't quit
waving like that.

303
00:30:56.874 --> 00:30:59.063
Towards you and toward that place.
I'll hold him. Go.

304
00:30:59.935 --> 00:31:01.196
Hold him, you go.

305
00:31:02.307 --> 00:31:04.419
Go! Now!

306
00:31:10.112 --> 00:31:12.181
- He past out.
- Very good.

307
00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.876
I'm gonna take advantage and stitch up,
let me see.

308
00:31:15.066 --> 00:31:15.935
Oh God!

309
00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.271
Water.

310
00:31:24.839 --> 00:31:27.016
Bridger, go tell the others we'll
camp here tonight.

311
00:31:27.548 --> 00:31:29.420
- I'm right here.
- Yes, sir.

312
00:31:30.599 --> 00:31:32.716
I'll be right here...

313
00:31:47.557 --> 00:31:49.018
Toussaint, he's here.

314
00:31:49.333 --> 00:31:51.869
I thought he wouldn't make it.

315
00:31:53.309 --> 00:31:54.753
I'm glad you made it here.

316
00:31:57.242 --> 00:32:00.315
We need horses and rifles.

317
00:32:00.661 --> 00:32:02.818
We bring you many pelts.

318
00:32:03.378 --> 00:32:06.644
No horses... just what we agreed.

319
00:32:07.967 --> 00:32:10.252
Take all the pelts you want.

320
00:32:10.638 --> 00:32:13.929
We need horses and rifles.

321
00:32:14.098 --> 00:32:16.228
I need a woman with big tits...

322
00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:18.510
Who can cook.

323
00:32:20.017 --> 00:32:21.573
We can't give you any horses.

324
00:32:23.009 --> 00:32:24.088
What's he saying?

325
00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:25.338
I don't know, something about horses.

326
00:32:25.423 --> 00:32:26.508
Bring us something to drink... some whisky.

327
00:32:26.673 --> 00:32:27.454
.

328
00:32:29.435 --> 00:32:30.877
Tell him to stop asking about the horses.

329
00:32:34.047 --> 00:32:35.837
Always good doing business with you.

330
00:32:36.106 --> 00:32:37.196
Horses.

331
00:32:38.143 --> 00:32:39.033
No horses.

332
00:32:40.371 --> 00:32:42.069
All we can trade are guns and ammunition.

333
00:32:42.195 --> 00:32:44.910
Tell him if he asks about horses again,
there is no deal.

334
00:32:46.851 --> 00:32:48.382
Where did you get these? The Americans?

335
00:32:48.408 --> 00:32:50.010
...

336
00:32:50.932 --> 00:32:52.071
They're already branded

337
00:32:52.992 --> 00:32:56.011
I'll only be able to get
half price for them.

338
00:32:57.900 --> 00:32:59.743
Get him away from there.

339
00:33:00.001 --> 00:33:01.547
I said no horses.

340
00:33:02.013 --> 00:33:03.612
We'll take these three horses.

341
00:33:04.322 --> 00:33:05.665
I'm not going to say it again.

342
00:33:06.204 --> 00:33:07.543
They aren't part of the deal.

343
00:33:07.852 --> 00:33:09.445
Now tell your man to step away.

344
00:33:09.744 --> 00:33:11.453
We had an agreement, you have to honor it.

345
00:33:12.952 --> 00:33:17.847
<i>In French</i>
You stand there and talk to me about honor?

346
00:33:18.502 --> 00:33:20.217
I told you he speaks French.

347
00:33:22.765 --> 00:33:24.331
Those pelts are stolen.

348
00:33:27.524 --> 00:33:28.523
.

349
00:33:29.198 --> 00:33:32.603
You all have stolen everything from us.

350
00:33:34.895 --> 00:33:36.245
Everything!

351
00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:38.075
The land.

352
00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:40.964
The animals.

353
00:33:41.438 --> 00:33:45.609
Two white men snuck into our village,
and took my daughter, Powaqa.

354
00:33:45.644 --> 00:33:50.385
.

355
00:33:50.666 --> 00:33:55.523
We leave you these pelts because honor
demands it

356
00:33:55.999 --> 00:33:58.649
I take your horses to find my daughter.

357
00:33:59.324 --> 00:34:01.713
You are free to try and stop me.

358
00:34:02.014 --> 00:34:03.519
.

359
00:34:06.531 --> 00:34:09.640
Business is business.

360
00:34:11.985 --> 00:34:14.943
Prepare five horses for them.

361
00:34:21.972 --> 00:34:24.126
I want everybody up at the crack of dawn.

362
00:34:24.207 --> 00:34:25.356
Yes sir. Understood Cap.

363
00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:27.347
Carrying Glass would be hard.

364
00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.371
We need to get ahead as far as possible.

365
00:34:31.416 --> 00:34:32.993
We'll divide into two groups.

366
00:34:33.748 --> 00:34:38.542
Fitzgerald, Jones, Fryman. You
take the east side of the river.

367
00:34:39.043 --> 00:34:40.953
Anderson you scout up front.

368
00:34:42.029 --> 00:34:45.264
- That claw don't mourn him.
- Everybody else takes turn carrying Glass.

369
00:34:45.454 --> 00:34:46.514
Yes, Captain.

370
00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:47.667
They're ain't for me.

371
00:35:29.567 --> 00:35:30.581
.

372
00:35:32.603 --> 00:35:33.993
Do not let him into the water...

373
00:35:34.103 --> 00:35:35.073
Get up.

374
00:35:36.444 --> 00:35:38.215
- Fuck off.
- That's an order!

375
00:36:02.309 --> 00:36:03.939
God dammit, don't let him down!

376
00:36:04.273 --> 00:36:05.777
Don't let him down.

377
00:36:17.811 --> 00:36:18.796
Watch it.

378
00:36:19.723 --> 00:36:21.295
How are we gonna make it up there?

379
00:36:21.529 --> 00:36:22.645
Slow down a bit.

380
00:36:22.747 --> 00:36:24.617
It's killing us Captain.

381
00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:33.525
Lift him Bridger.

382
00:36:35.414 --> 00:36:37.097
Keep it steady...

383
00:36:39.586 --> 00:36:40.501
Everybody.

384
00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:42.337
And here...

385
00:36:43.657 --> 00:36:44.769
I'm gonna go up and pull...

386
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:48.518
Here...

387
00:36:49.662 --> 00:36:50.779
Hold it.

388
00:36:54.001 --> 00:36:57.659
Enough of this shit. We'll never make it
across land this way.

389
00:36:58.633 --> 00:36:59.941
He is burning out Captain.

390
00:37:02.309 --> 00:37:04.169
Captain you ain't doing us nor him...

391
00:37:04.361 --> 00:37:07.805
no favor... going on
suffering like this.

392
00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:08.922
Captain!

393
00:37:09.336 --> 00:37:13.513
Captain, it's all the same up here.
We have to go back.

394
00:37:14.331 --> 00:37:15.570
Find another way.

395
00:37:19.684 --> 00:37:20.688
Hold on.

396
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:24.144
Glass...
Hugh...

397
00:37:26.637 --> 00:37:28.652
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

398
00:37:29.342 --> 00:37:31.990
Plant that rag over his eyes Mr. Bridger.

399
00:37:32.231 --> 00:37:33.622
- What?
- Sir, I can't.

400
00:37:33.646 --> 00:37:35.116
Plant that rag over his eyes.

401
00:37:35.151 --> 00:37:36.586
- What, wait.
- Sorry Hugh.

402
00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:40.171
- Wait. - Sir, I can't do that.
- How do we get back without him?

403
00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.025
- He's the only one who knows the way.
- He can't go any further.

404
00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:43.342
- Wave that rag over his eyes.
- Wait.

405
00:37:43.377 --> 00:37:44.315
Sir, I can't.

406
00:37:44.339 --> 00:37:45.379
Wait, you can't...

407
00:37:47.464 --> 00:37:49.114
Put a rag over his eyes.

408
00:37:49.978 --> 00:37:51.386
Lay it over his eyes.

409
00:37:52.325 --> 00:37:53.366
Step back.

410
00:37:56.819 --> 00:37:58.561
Stop, Mr. Henry...

411
00:37:59.138 --> 00:38:00.440
Henry, please.

412
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:01.889
Captain, Captain...

413
00:38:01.949 --> 00:38:03.070
Hey, Hawk!

414
00:38:04.247 --> 00:38:05.463
Calm down kid.

415
00:38:05.856 --> 00:38:06.876
Calm down.

416
00:38:11.756 --> 00:38:13.552
Henry, please...

417
00:38:13.813 --> 00:38:16.945
There's a $70 bonus in the
Rocky Mountains Fur Company...

418
00:38:17.042 --> 00:38:18.516
for two men, who stays...

419
00:38:18.551 --> 00:38:20.395
back with Glass, to see this through.

420
00:38:20.399 --> 00:38:21.954
- I'll stay.
- Me too.

421
00:38:22.187 --> 00:38:23.257
Money or not, I'll stay.

422
00:38:24.888 --> 00:38:26.176
I need a third.

423
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:28.754
Sorry Captain, I have family...

424
00:38:29.659 --> 00:38:30.996
I am not crazy.

425
00:38:32.006 --> 00:38:35.284
Captain, three men can't
hold off a party of Ree.

426
00:38:35.308 --> 00:38:36.560
Much less boys.

427
00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:40.323
Besides, $70 ain't going
by nobody lose their ears.

428
00:38:40.347 --> 00:38:41.449
100 then.

429
00:38:42.262 --> 00:38:44.264
This man is the only
reason we're still alive.

430
00:38:44.475 --> 00:38:49.090
Oh Captain, we were 45 men when we started,
now we're 10, almost 9.

431
00:38:49.455 --> 00:38:51.305
- He's my father, you can have my share.

432
00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:52.426
- Mine too.

433
00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:53.714
- Have our share also.

434
00:38:58.542 --> 00:38:59.633
Alright.

435
00:39:00.394 --> 00:39:03.485
Alright, if Mr. Bridger feels the same way,
then I'll lead behind of them.

436
00:39:03.554 --> 00:39:04.573
- You?
- Yeah.

437
00:39:04.834 --> 00:39:07.196
You already lost my share of the pelts...

438
00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.928
So I don't got much choice but to try
make it up some other means.

439
00:39:11.001 --> 00:39:13.874
Besides, sticking around for another
day or two don't make no difference.

440
00:39:13.984 --> 00:39:16.697
$300, is to get to go home with something.

441
00:39:16.783 --> 00:39:18.660
Glass is to be cared for until...

442
00:39:18.684 --> 00:39:19.610
Understood?

443
00:39:19.925 --> 00:39:21.599
Yeah. You have my word, understand.

444
00:39:24.547 --> 00:39:27.193
You boys get him down of this slope
there somewhere safe before the dark.

445
00:39:27.228 --> 00:39:28.607
You heard the boys.

446
00:39:28.642 --> 00:39:29.986
- Fitzgerald.
- Captain.

447
00:39:31.857 --> 00:39:34.152
Glass is to be cared for
as long as necessary.

448
00:39:34.704 --> 00:39:37.607
And a proper burial when it's time.
He's earned it.

449
00:39:38.933 --> 00:39:40.309
Understand.

450
00:39:55.292 --> 00:39:58.950
Can you hear the wind, Father?

451
00:40:00.876 --> 00:40:07.282
Remember what mother
used to say about wind?

452
00:40:07.834 --> 00:40:15.793
The wind cannot defeat a
tree with strong roots.

453
00:40:18.449 --> 00:40:21.685
You are still breathing...

454
00:40:25.361 --> 00:40:29.129
I miss her so much.

455
00:40:49.837 --> 00:40:51.920
I will be right here...

456
00:40:54.252 --> 00:40:56.233
I'm right here.

457
00:41:00.929 --> 00:41:05.511
As long as you can still
grab a breath, you fight.

458
00:41:07.309 --> 00:41:09.918
You breathe. Keep breathing.

459
00:41:09.942 --> 00:41:13.759
When there is a storm...

460
00:41:16.686 --> 00:41:21.960
And you stand in front of a tree...

461
00:41:26.238 --> 00:41:33.289
If you look at its branches,
you swear it will fall.

462
00:41:43.423 --> 00:41:51.360
But if you watch the trunk,
you will see its stability.

463
00:42:33.293 --> 00:42:36.186
$300 goes alongway toward retiring...

464
00:42:36.809 --> 00:42:39.633
Way down to Texas, buy me
a decent piece of land...

465
00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:41.354
And start pissing in the wind.

466
00:42:42.292 --> 00:42:45.042
Getting the hell out of
this godforsaken places.

467
00:42:49.882 --> 00:42:51.200
- Did Ree done that to you?

468
00:42:53.265 --> 00:42:54.401
- I was just asking.

469
00:42:55.746 --> 00:42:57.021
They done it.

470
00:42:58.133 --> 00:43:00.375
They took their sweet (?) with it too.

471
00:43:01.741 --> 00:43:02.909
At the start I didn't feel nothing,

472
00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:04.650
I just heard the sound of...

473
00:43:05.062 --> 00:43:07.253
knife scraping against
my skull, you know...

474
00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:11.738
They were all laughin' and whoopin'
and hollerin' what not...

475
00:43:12.487 --> 00:43:14.082
Then the blood came...

476
00:43:14.319 --> 00:43:18.040
The cold started streaming down
my face and my eyes...

477
00:43:19.051 --> 00:43:20.369
The breathing it in...

478
00:43:20.991 --> 00:43:22.290
choking on it.

479
00:43:24.261 --> 00:43:25.764
That's when I felt it.

480
00:43:26.795 --> 00:43:28.107
I felt all of it.

481
00:43:29.513 --> 00:43:31.434
They got my head turned inside out.

482
00:43:32.955 --> 00:43:33.641
Jesus.

483
00:43:34.058 --> 00:43:36.050
Yeah, them Indians down Texas way...

484
00:43:36.399 --> 00:43:38.553
they may rob you,
ain't gonna take your topknot.

485
00:43:40.649 --> 00:43:41.858
When was it?

486
00:43:45.297 --> 00:43:48.890
God damn, will you just,
would you quit that noise now, will ya?

487
00:43:48.925 --> 00:43:51.226
Or just... Leave it.

488
00:44:17.235 --> 00:44:21.550
I'm following further back from heading against
the boys on account of tending to you.

489
00:44:25.794 --> 00:44:28.911
We got to get up that damn mountain but
the wind keeps chasing us down.

490
00:44:32.433 --> 00:44:33.535
If you're ready...

491
00:44:33.793 --> 00:44:35.337
Take the sacrament.

492
00:44:36.849 --> 00:44:38.047
I can do that for you.

493
00:44:43.882 --> 00:44:45.582
What you holding to Glass?

494
00:44:49.543 --> 00:44:50.655
You know?

495
00:44:51.455 --> 00:44:52.859
Would be better...

496
00:44:53.226 --> 00:44:56.106
If you would've take that last
breath of yours now.

497
00:44:56.687 --> 00:44:57.869
For all of us.

498
00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:02.541
You hung tough.

499
00:45:02.979 --> 00:45:04.050
That's something.

500
00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:06.931
I'm begging you Glass.

501
00:45:07.005 --> 00:45:09.469
Them Ree, they are so close now
I can smell them...

502
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:11.645
and I know you can smell them to,
when you got to think.

503
00:45:11.695 --> 00:45:13.092
You gotta think of your boy.

504
00:45:13.584 --> 00:45:15.846
Alright? Cause you're gonna kill him.

505
00:45:15.923 --> 00:45:17.534
You'll kill all of us.

506
00:45:25.036 --> 00:45:26.764
I can muzzle you if you like.

507
00:45:27.437 --> 00:45:29.744
Take away the suffering,
really quick and easy...

508
00:45:29.768 --> 00:45:31.845
No one has to know that you give up.
I do that.

509
00:45:33.484 --> 00:45:35.269
All you gotta to do is blink...

510
00:45:35.293 --> 00:45:36.552
If you want me to do that.

511
00:45:43.035 --> 00:45:44.931
Save your boy and blink.

512
00:45:55.123 --> 00:45:56.892
You just have to blink.

513
00:46:02.429 --> 00:46:03.362
Yeah.

514
00:46:03.397 --> 00:46:04.452
Oh yes!

515
00:46:05.378 --> 00:46:08.276
You best hope that the good Lord
get his ass here quick, huh.

516
00:46:12.789 --> 00:46:14.900
Maybe he'll forgive your sins, you know
maybe he won't...

517
00:46:15.073 --> 00:46:17.091
You just sudden commend it
to the Lord.

518
00:46:18.542 --> 00:46:22.391
Through Jesus Christ, the Lord
of all reality and mercy...

519
00:46:26.872 --> 00:46:29.095
Get away. Get away.

520
00:46:29.677 --> 00:46:32.651
You ok? Jim. Jim... Help.

521
00:46:44.244 --> 00:46:46.915
- Help.
- Calm down. Alright, you don't understand.

522
00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:51.702
- Don't shout, you'll get us all fuckin' killed.
- Keep away.

523
00:46:51.832 --> 00:46:54.535
I'll tell Jim and the Captain what you did
and they'll hang you.

524
00:46:54.559 --> 00:46:57.012
- You have to understand this...
- They'll hang you...

525
00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:59.527
Jim help. Jim get over here.

526
00:46:59.868 --> 00:47:01.606
Keep quiet!!

527
00:47:16.253 --> 00:47:17.266
Shit.

528
00:48:18.576 --> 00:48:19.826
Got one beaver half.

529
00:48:22.241 --> 00:48:23.562
His breathing changed?

530
00:48:25.449 --> 00:48:26.810
I ain't noticed.

531
00:48:28.797 --> 00:48:30.193
Damn, he's cold as ice.

532
00:48:32.281 --> 00:48:35.130
Here Mr. Glass... This will help...

533
00:48:35.933 --> 00:48:37.154
It will keep you warm.

534
00:48:38.094 --> 00:48:39.056
It's alright.

535
00:48:41.185 --> 00:48:42.109
Where is Hawk?

536
00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:45.203
He ain't with you?

537
00:48:47.053 --> 00:48:48.492
- No.
- No?

538
00:48:54.378 --> 00:48:55.762
I understand Mr. Glass.

539
00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:57.397
Alright.

540
00:48:58.168 --> 00:48:59.642
I think I'm gonna get a fire going.

541
00:48:59.844 --> 00:49:01.787
Yeah, sounds like a good idea.

542
00:49:08.768 --> 00:49:09.668
Hawk!

543
00:49:10.276 --> 00:49:13.193
You killed my son.

544
00:49:13.217 --> 00:49:14.210
Hawk!

545
00:49:36.125 --> 00:49:40.301
Bridge, there's about 20
of them down by the creek.

546
00:49:41.038 --> 00:49:42.285
They're headed this way.

547
00:49:42.676 --> 00:49:44.387
Now grab your shit and let's go.

548
00:49:46.299 --> 00:49:48.580
Shit. Wait. What do we do?

549
00:49:48.994 --> 00:49:50.421
- Run right now.

550
00:49:50.806 --> 00:49:53.494
- What about Hawk?
- He ain't our problem no more.

551
00:49:54.446 --> 00:49:55.635
We can't just leave him here.

552
00:49:55.659 --> 00:49:57.434
- He's going to be scalped.

553
00:49:58.030 --> 00:49:59.749
If that Ree can find us, can't he?

554
00:49:59.784 --> 00:50:01.469
- Wait. What about Glass?

555
00:50:01.676 --> 00:50:04.170
He ain't our problem no more,
he is like us, he's on his own.

556
00:50:04.765 --> 00:50:07.192
No, no, we made a promise to Captain...

557
00:50:07.285 --> 00:50:08.797
I'll give him a proper burial
when the time is needed.

558
00:50:08.865 --> 00:50:10.141
Well he needs that rifle.

559
00:50:10.665 --> 00:50:13.064
He can't do nothing with it if
you tarred it to his hands.

560
00:50:13.088 --> 00:50:14.859
Now come on get your shit. Let's go.

561
00:50:14.986 --> 00:50:16.251
No, no, we can't do this.

562
00:50:16.895 --> 00:50:19.806
- We got no fucking choice.
- We can't. Look at him.

563
00:50:22.703 --> 00:50:24.502
- Alright, shitting brain...
- What you doin?

564
00:50:25.188 --> 00:50:27.112
Can you take him? Come on.

565
00:50:27.152 --> 00:50:28.524
No, no wait...

566
00:50:30.683 --> 00:50:32.247
Easy, slowly Fitz...

567
00:50:32.404 --> 00:50:33.271
Easy.

568
00:50:34.373 --> 00:50:37.029
- I can't...
- Damn...

569
00:50:37.890 --> 00:50:38.998
Shit, get this shit.

570
00:50:39.529 --> 00:50:40.326
- Wait, hold...

571
00:50:40.361 --> 00:50:41.353
- Hold on!

572
00:50:45.645 --> 00:50:46.524
Shut up.

573
00:50:47.228 --> 00:50:48.385
- Hold on.

574
00:50:51.567 --> 00:50:52.527
- Fitz...

575
00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:54.680
- What are you doing?
- What it looks like I'm doing?

576
00:50:55.474 --> 00:50:56.616
A proper burial.

577
00:50:56.706 --> 00:50:57.633
Like he wanted.

578
00:50:57.986 --> 00:51:00.337
- No, not like this.
- Why not?

579
00:51:02.061 --> 00:51:04.390
- He is alive Fitz. He's alive.

580
00:51:06.656 --> 00:51:07.786
So shoot him.

581
00:51:20.831 --> 00:51:22.742
I have to go, I have to...

582
00:51:25.131 --> 00:51:26.028
I'm sorry.

583
00:51:27.303 --> 00:51:28.558
I'm sorry.

584
00:51:43.354 --> 00:51:45.434
Captain, this way...

585
00:51:46.833 --> 00:51:48.684
There's a path down here.

586
00:51:48.719 --> 00:51:50.815
There's no way through down here.

587
00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:54.322
There ain't shit down there,
we go climb over.

588
00:51:54.370 --> 00:51:57.117
- Cross can go to hell.

589
00:51:59.062 --> 00:52:01.082
- What does the map say?
- Keep climbing.

590
00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:02.602
We climb Captain.

591
00:52:02.942 --> 00:52:04.473
We keep climbing.

592
00:52:04.718 --> 00:52:06.225
Until we reach our gate.

593
00:52:10.679 --> 00:52:11.646
Climb.

594
00:52:13.606 --> 00:52:14.869
- You got away from Murph?
- Yeah.

595
00:52:15.281 --> 00:52:16.522
- You wait for it.

596
00:52:17.919 --> 00:52:18.766
- Captain.

597
00:52:22.078 --> 00:52:25.200
- Sir. Murphy says there's
a way down there.

598
00:52:26.187 --> 00:52:27.352
- Who we following?

599
00:52:27.448 --> 00:52:28.858
- You follow who you want.

600
00:52:28.893 --> 00:52:30.059
- I'm going up.

601
00:52:31.724 --> 00:52:35.222
We all need to be going up.
Blair, come here!

602
00:55:57.613 --> 00:56:01.674
I'm not leaving you, son.

603
00:56:03.359 --> 00:56:04.830
I'm right here.

604
00:57:11.647 --> 00:57:12.968
Fire's done.

605
00:57:14.629 --> 00:57:16.136
I can't still feel my feet...

606
00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:21.476
Besides, didn't we put enough distance
between us and them Ree anyhow?

607
00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:22.309
Well...

608
00:57:22.492 --> 00:57:24.667
a dozen Ree could still made
twice the good time as we can.

609
00:57:24.691 --> 00:57:26.234
- 20.
- What?

610
00:57:28.655 --> 00:57:30.564
I thought you said that
you saw 20 Ree before.

611
00:57:30.596 --> 00:57:32.166
Yeah, what you talking about?

612
00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:36.787
You woke me up?

613
00:57:38.696 --> 00:57:40.631
You said you saw 20 Ree down by the creek.

614
00:57:41.077 --> 00:57:44.013
Well yeah, 20 or dozen, it don't matter...

615
00:57:44.172 --> 00:57:45.505
I wasn't gonna exactly
hang around the creek

616
00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:47.116
counting fuckin' feathers, now would I?

617
00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:51.770
Matter a fact.

618
00:57:54.057 --> 00:57:56.178
What was you doing down by the creek
all by yourself?

619
00:57:57.473 --> 00:57:59.239
I thought I already brought
up plenty of water.

620
00:58:01.366 --> 00:58:02.357
Hey!

621
00:58:03.843 --> 00:58:05.673
Answer me Fitzgerald, I
asked you a question.

622
00:58:07.492 --> 00:58:10.127
Don't go questioning me now on the
account of fact that we all feel...

623
00:58:10.151 --> 00:58:12.704
- guilty about leaving this Glass behind.
- Answer me or I'm gonna blow your head off.

624
00:58:12.895 --> 00:58:14.540
You got a short memory boy.

625
00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:17.958
Your ass is still be floatin around
Missouri right now...

626
00:58:17.982 --> 00:58:19.116
If it wasn't for me.

627
00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:22.948
Now wanna ask questions...

628
00:58:23.648 --> 00:58:25.420
What you want ask if
you won't know asking.

629
00:58:27.677 --> 00:58:30.457
You want to know why you left Mr.Glass
back there for dead, hah?

630
00:58:31.178 --> 00:58:32.246
Maybe...

631
00:58:32.507 --> 00:58:37.354
while you left your little boy friend wandering around, you
don't know if he's still alive yet. That what you want to know?

632
00:58:37.696 --> 00:58:39.836
I'll tell you lies 'cause
you ain't a man yet.

633
00:58:40.501 --> 00:58:42.498
Alright? Because you were scared shitless

634
00:58:42.522 --> 00:58:43.915
and you're scared now.
Now put your rifle down.

635
00:58:44.225 --> 00:58:46.071
- The Ree.
- What off it?

636
00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:49.740
Tell me right now and be honest.
Did you see 'em?

637
00:58:49.764 --> 00:58:51.257
- Put your rifle down.
- Did you see the Ree?

638
00:58:53.908 --> 00:58:55.063
No.

639
00:58:56.415 --> 00:58:57.815
Not a single one.

640
00:59:00.755 --> 00:59:02.189
- You fucking lie to me?

641
00:59:02.711 --> 00:59:03.958
- You lie to me!

642
00:59:08.113 --> 00:59:10.314
I had to scare some sense into you boy.

643
00:59:11.084 --> 00:59:13.404
Now Glass was dead, Hawk
we don't know about...

644
00:59:13.484 --> 00:59:15.723
There is no point either of us
dying here... Do you understand?

645
00:59:16.561 --> 00:59:18.741
The way I see it, I saved
your life twice now son.

646
00:59:18.765 --> 00:59:20.313
I ought to be God to you...

647
00:59:21.689 --> 00:59:24.654
And God giveth, God taketh away.

648
00:59:28.930 --> 00:59:29.828
Shit.

649
00:59:32.211 --> 00:59:33.367
Fuck.

650
00:59:34.959 --> 00:59:36.728
Next time, if you want to shoot somebody...

651
00:59:36.752 --> 00:59:39.780
you might wanna use, you
might wanna use powder.

652
00:59:40.109 --> 00:59:41.527
Prime your rifle.

653
00:59:44.738 --> 00:59:45.591
Come on...

654
00:59:46.231 --> 00:59:48.492
let's get up. Grab your shit.

655
01:03:49.538 --> 01:03:52.592
Fresh blood. This could be Powaqa.

656
01:04:05.179 --> 01:04:06.443
A dead guy.

657
01:04:15.441 --> 01:04:16.839
A Pawnee boy.

658
01:04:17.837 --> 01:04:18.909
Let's go.

659
01:07:32.321 --> 01:07:34.515
Captain wait...

660
01:14:28.091 --> 01:14:30.546
- Who did this?
- I don't know.

661
01:14:38.783 --> 01:14:41.146
Could be Captain Leavenworth boys.

662
01:14:43.746 --> 01:14:44.703
Hmm, yeah.

663
01:14:45.808 --> 01:14:47.757
You put some eyes on the back of your head.

664
01:14:51.383 --> 01:14:54.143
These Indians ain't never as dead as you'll
think they are.

665
01:14:55.395 --> 01:14:58.608
Look at them, they're
always stinking of shit.

666
01:15:35.682 --> 01:15:37.084
We got horses over here.

667
01:15:41.843 --> 01:15:42.954
Alright, Bridger.

668
01:15:48.726 --> 01:15:49.818
We got horses.

669
01:15:56.015 --> 01:15:57.753
What you wanna do about this pigs?

670
01:16:05.221 --> 01:16:06.878
Lord is on our side kid.

671
01:16:15.874 --> 01:16:16.914
You alright there kid?

672
01:16:17.758 --> 01:16:18.957
You're head in the right place?

673
01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:21.139
I guess.

674
01:16:26.754 --> 01:16:29.014
- Can't help thinking about whether we did the right...
- No.

675
01:16:29.785 --> 01:16:31.182
Ain't our place to wonder.

676
01:16:31.541 --> 01:16:34.450
Good Lord's got us on the road, whether we
chose or not.

677
01:16:38.595 --> 01:16:41.420
My Pa being one ...wasn't a
religious man you, you know?

678
01:16:41.935 --> 01:16:44.033
If you couldn't grow it,
or kill it or eat it...

679
01:16:44.275 --> 01:16:46.537
then he just plain all didn't
believe in it and that was it.

680
01:16:47.874 --> 01:16:50.855
And this one time he hit
on up the old Saber hills.

681
01:16:51.114 --> 01:16:52.402
San Saber Hills...

682
01:16:53.751 --> 01:16:56.848
Joined up with a couple of Texan range
buddies of his to hunt, you know.

683
01:16:57.654 --> 01:17:00.572
Pretty routine, you know, they done it
like hundred times before.

684
01:17:00.663 --> 01:17:05.603
Should have been three days of kill, but
on Saturday, well it all went fucked.

685
01:17:06.215 --> 01:17:08.548
Somehow that night he
has to lose buddies...

686
01:17:08.583 --> 01:17:09.890
And on top of it all...

687
01:17:10.548 --> 01:17:13.327
The Comanche's they went
and took the horses, so...

688
01:17:13.704 --> 01:17:15.111
He was starving,

689
01:17:15.135 --> 01:17:16.405
delirious...

690
01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:19.611
And crawls up into this mud...

691
01:17:20.244 --> 01:17:23.158
Like the group of trees out there
in the middle of nowhere...

692
01:17:23.252 --> 01:17:25.771
just sticking up in
this ocean of scrub...

693
01:17:25.808 --> 01:17:27.568
And he found religion.

694
01:17:28.924 --> 01:17:30.218
At that moment...

695
01:17:30.242 --> 01:17:31.336
he told me...

696
01:17:31.958 --> 01:17:33.206
He found God.

697
01:17:40.612 --> 01:17:42.100
It turns out...

698
01:17:42.393 --> 01:17:43.561
The God...

699
01:17:45.037 --> 01:17:46.298
He is a squirrel.

700
01:17:47.617 --> 01:17:49.797
Yeah. Then go meet him one...

701
01:17:52.853 --> 01:17:55.111
I found God, he used to say.

702
01:17:56.583 --> 01:17:58.759
Who has sitting and basking...

703
01:17:58.954 --> 01:18:01.129
in glory in subliminal mercy...

704
01:18:02.953 --> 01:18:05.088
I shot knee that son of a bitch...

705
01:18:19.148 --> 01:18:21.128
Yeah, you might wanna close your eyes kid.

706
01:27:06.312 --> 01:27:08.918
I'm injured.

707
01:27:10.023 --> 01:27:11.095
What happened to you?

708
01:27:14.012 --> 01:27:17.430
A bear.

709
01:27:19.431 --> 01:27:20.704
A Grizzly.

710
01:27:39.314 --> 01:27:42.752
My men... left me for dead.

711
01:27:43.383 --> 01:27:46.107
Killed my son.

712
01:27:49.712 --> 01:27:53.000
I lost my family too.

713
01:27:55.244 --> 01:27:57.312
Sioux killed my people.

714
01:27:58.780 --> 01:28:07.203
I'm going south to find more Pawnee.

715
01:28:09.067 --> 01:28:10.770
My heart bleeds...

716
01:28:13.950 --> 01:28:16.945
But revenge is in the creator's hands.

717
01:28:25.765 --> 01:28:26.957
You will ride with me...

718
01:29:35.062 --> 01:29:36.478
Your body is rotten.

719
01:29:37.881 --> 01:29:39.184
Need to heal.

720
01:29:44.914 --> 01:29:45.998
You could die.

721
01:30:01.052 --> 01:30:02.141
Yeah!

722
01:30:02.227 --> 01:30:03.913
There she is.

723
01:30:05.653 --> 01:30:06.847
We did it.

724
01:30:08.111 --> 01:30:10.342
You ought to be proud of yourself boy.

725
01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:12.361
Yeah.

726
01:30:12.666 --> 01:30:15.735
Well we followed orders... We just kept
the funeral apart.

727
01:30:16.472 --> 01:30:19.581
Don't go down there starting going
no kind no conscience, alright?

728
01:30:20.056 --> 01:30:23.039
Cause sure is neither come will have
us both swinging from couple grants.

729
01:30:24.131 --> 01:30:26.050
Now, we did what we had to do.

730
01:30:54.692 --> 01:30:57.406
We had the extra day, so we managed
to dig a little deeper...

731
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:59.712
leave some rocks on top, so that
the scavengers couldn't get out to him...

732
01:30:59.782 --> 01:31:01.559
we was done right and all.

733
01:31:02.646 --> 01:31:04.102
He was buried right.

734
01:31:04.793 --> 01:31:07.288
- Sir...
- The truth is that, ah...

735
01:31:08.773 --> 01:31:11.597
When Hawk disappeared,
I was worried about the savages.

736
01:31:12.027 --> 01:31:16.484
I was ready to get...
moving on out you know, but...

737
01:31:17.227 --> 01:31:19.570
Bridger here, he argued to stay.

738
01:31:20.567 --> 01:31:22.242
He argued to stay so that...

739
01:31:22.551 --> 01:31:25.252
He could at least build
the cross, or something...

740
01:31:25.991 --> 01:31:29.011
To put on top of Glass's grave,
and that's what he did...

741
01:31:29.948 --> 01:31:32.348
- That's what we did.
- Glad to hear you pulled your weight Mr. Bridger.

742
01:31:32.383 --> 01:31:33.356
I know you would.

743
01:31:33.380 --> 01:31:37.376
Yeah, well, more than he pulled his weight
Captain is, this man here, he was my partner.

744
01:31:40.395 --> 01:31:41.480
Alright.

745
01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:47.524
Am I to assume that there was agreed
arrangement did not changed?

746
01:31:47.632 --> 01:31:49.772
Fortunately for me it did not, no.

747
01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:13.338
Thank you.

748
01:32:14.301 --> 01:32:16.241
For your courage, honor...

749
01:32:16.630 --> 01:32:18.031
- And service.
- Yeah.

750
01:32:19.188 --> 01:32:22.671
Deal or no deal Mr. Bridger, you deserve
something for what you did.

751
01:32:23.512 --> 01:32:24.368
Thank you.

752
01:32:35.198 --> 01:32:38.749
Kid's been beating himself up of
the bag hole trip.

753
01:32:42.250 --> 01:32:46.425
We all saw the shape Glass was in,
it was no more to be done, right?

754
01:32:47.548 --> 01:32:48.474
Yeah.

755
01:32:50.172 --> 01:32:51.617
We all saw it.

756
01:33:00.429 --> 01:33:02.026
.

757
01:33:02.061 --> 01:33:02.605
.

758
01:33:02.906 --> 01:33:04.269
.

759
01:36:18.168 --> 01:36:22.040
When there is a storm...

760
01:36:24.458 --> 01:36:30.121
And you stand in front of a tree...

761
01:36:31.589 --> 01:36:37.554
If you look at its branches,
you swear it will fall...

762
01:36:43.499 --> 01:36:52.383
But if you watch the trunk,
you will see its stability.

763
01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:12.270
WE ARE ALL WILD

764
01:42:13.072 --> 01:42:15.431
There are traces of a camp...

765
01:42:16.289 --> 01:42:18.346
There are traces of a camp...

766
01:42:20.297 --> 01:42:21.163
Where?

767
01:42:21.387 --> 01:42:23.819
Entering the moon forest.

768
01:42:24.857 --> 01:42:29.236
Maybe two days ago.
They are moving east.

769
01:42:29.769 --> 01:42:31.741
Tell the others.

770
01:42:32.344 --> 01:42:35.533
Let's move quickly,
Powaqa could be with them!

771
01:42:56.675 --> 01:42:58.188
Bring me the girl...

772
01:42:59.435 --> 01:43:01.752
Those five horses
weren't for free.

773
01:44:26.033 --> 01:44:27.408
Don't make a sound.

774
01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:32.962
Be quiet.

775
01:44:43.177 --> 01:44:49.448
I will get a horse.

776
01:44:50.037 --> 01:44:53.969
I'll cut off your balls.

777
01:45:08.789 --> 01:45:11.084
Where is Toussaint?

778
01:45:14.513 --> 01:45:15.953
Come here...

779
01:46:07.729 --> 01:46:09.764
- May I join you?
- Yes.

780
01:46:09.799 --> 01:46:11.013
- Yeah?
- Yes.

781
01:46:12.017 --> 01:46:15.195
Damn I was wondering when we might
be getting paid for that haul?

782
01:46:17.130 --> 01:46:19.752
Cause them pelts we collect,
they are still out there...

783
01:46:20.429 --> 01:46:24.174
They're covered with dirt and some snow, but
they are there, and that ain't my fault.

784
01:46:25.021 --> 01:46:27.780
I'm waiting for Captain Leavenworth
to arrive with his army...

785
01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:29.481
And then we'll have enough men...

786
01:46:29.545 --> 01:46:31.674
To get back out there
and shoot some civilization...

787
01:46:31.702 --> 01:46:35.322
into those fucking Arikara,
get back our pelts.

788
01:46:35.412 --> 01:46:37.124
Alright, alright.

789
01:46:38.101 --> 01:46:39.843
And now when is that supposed to happen?

790
01:46:40.666 --> 01:46:41.818
I don't know but...

791
01:46:42.251 --> 01:46:43.938
Until then nobody gets paid.

792
01:46:46.679 --> 01:46:48.377
Listen here, alright?

793
01:46:49.265 --> 01:46:52.523
I was hired to trap them...
I wasn't hired to guard them.

794
01:46:53.227 --> 01:46:58.106
The way I see it... you got a safe.

795
01:46:58.266 --> 01:47:00.809
- Probably full of money.
- You signed a contract.

796
01:47:01.454 --> 01:47:04.069
To protect your boss and
your boss's property.

797
01:47:05.454 --> 01:47:08.404
And that safe isn't full anymore,
it's short about $300.

798
01:47:08.439 --> 01:47:11.781
Short? Short? What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

799
01:47:12.483 --> 01:47:14.483
It means according to my cash records...

800
01:47:14.507 --> 01:47:18.020
You purchased more goods on the expedition
than what you are owed by the company.

801
01:47:23.629 --> 01:47:25.294
Happy New Year, Fitzgerald.

802
01:56:18.221 --> 01:56:20.384
FITZGERALD
KILLED MY SON

803
01:56:33.534 --> 01:56:34.739
White man at the gate.

804
01:56:42.169 --> 01:56:45.710
What's up? Who you are?

805
01:56:49.103 --> 01:56:51.488
I have no weapon, I have no weapons.

806
01:56:53.023 --> 01:56:55.303
- Dobb, get the Captain.
- I have no weapon.

807
01:56:55.363 --> 01:56:56.580
Where are your men?

808
01:56:57.120 --> 01:56:58.863
- Dead, all dead.
- Who was he?

809
01:57:00.144 --> 01:57:02.749
I don't know, something to eat please.

810
01:57:02.828 --> 01:57:04.069
Food comes at price.

811
01:57:05.504 --> 01:57:08.277
- I have no money.
- Then you don't eat this, see how that works.

812
01:57:08.301 --> 01:57:11.248
Maybe you can give back some of them stolen
pelts you buy from the Indians.

813
01:57:11.372 --> 01:57:13.274
- Not now Jones.
- Silver.

814
01:57:13.309 --> 01:57:14.445
This is silver.

815
01:57:15.781 --> 01:57:17.069
Oh yeah?

816
01:57:18.077 --> 01:57:19.133
This all you got?

817
01:57:21.662 --> 01:57:26.337
We was 9... But my friend
he died in the snow...

818
01:57:26.701 --> 01:57:27.950
And the others were...

819
01:57:28.998 --> 01:57:32.032
By wolves... by wolves...

820
01:57:33.409 --> 01:57:34.945
Wait where did you get this?

821
01:57:35.863 --> 01:57:37.191
The canteen.

822
01:57:37.737 --> 01:57:39.707
He... he drop it in the snow.

823
01:57:40.232 --> 01:57:43.834
- Who, who?
- I do not know, I don't see. I don't see.

824
01:57:46.042 --> 01:57:47.119
It could be Hawk.

825
01:57:49.903 --> 01:57:53.099
- Yeah, it could be.

826
01:57:53.223 --> 01:57:54.843
- Maybe it was the Weston.
- How far from here?

827
01:57:55.090 --> 01:57:57.401
- How far from here?
- 13 miles...

828
01:57:57.542 --> 01:58:01.076
Northwest... Near the Yellowstone.

829
01:58:01.100 --> 01:58:02.443
- Get the horses saddled.

830
01:58:03.064 --> 01:58:04.980
- Torches and supplies, $10 a men.

831
01:58:05.798 --> 01:58:08.337
- Anderson, you stay here.
- Yes sir.

832
01:58:08.489 --> 01:58:10.061
- Feed him and watch him...

833
01:58:11.751 --> 01:58:13.024
- I'll get you a drink.

834
01:58:25.614 --> 01:58:26.773
Open the gate.

835
01:59:04.572 --> 01:59:05.719
- Keep your guard up.

836
01:59:08.037 --> 01:59:09.133
- Eyes in front.

837
01:59:11.150 --> 01:59:12.233
Nice and easy.

838
01:59:14.916 --> 01:59:16.356
Slow.

839
01:59:21.092 --> 01:59:22.221
Who you are?

840
01:59:22.752 --> 01:59:24.737
Beckett? Is that you?

841
01:59:24.738 --> 01:59:25.843
Weston?

842
01:59:36.324 --> 01:59:37.203
Glass.

843
01:59:38.141 --> 01:59:39.272
- That's Glass...
- Glass...

844
01:59:39.307 --> 01:59:40.220
It's okay.

845
01:59:40.532 --> 01:59:41.775
Jesus Christ.

846
01:59:42.260 --> 01:59:43.583
Jesus Christ, what happened?

847
01:59:44.875 --> 01:59:46.096
Where is he?

848
01:59:49.363 --> 01:59:50.932
Johns take him, go.

849
01:59:51.488 --> 01:59:52.880
Go, I'm riding ahead.

850
01:59:52.974 --> 01:59:54.485
- Phil.
- Take Bridger.

851
01:59:55.732 --> 01:59:56.875
Take Bridger.

852
01:59:57.168 --> 01:59:58.683
- You got it Glass.
- Go.

853
02:00:05.330 --> 02:00:06.450
Open the gate.

854
02:00:11.644 --> 02:00:13.507
- Have you seen Fitzgerald?
- No sir.

855
02:00:19.797 --> 02:00:20.682
Get up.

856
02:00:21.364 --> 02:00:22.211
Get up.

857
02:00:22.251 --> 02:00:23.824
- Have you seen Fitzgerald?
- No sir.

858
02:00:23.859 --> 02:00:24.742
Fitzgerald.

859
02:00:36.002 --> 02:00:37.264
- Oh easy.
- Where did he go?

860
02:00:38.846 --> 02:00:40.046
- Who?
- Fitzgerald.

861
02:00:40.299 --> 02:00:41.260
Where did he go?

862
02:00:42.111 --> 02:00:44.554
- I have no idea.
- Tell me or I'll take your head off.

863
02:00:44.558 --> 02:00:47.370
- Captain, I swear to God.
- Tell me!

864
02:00:47.813 --> 02:00:49.303
- Tell me!
- Texas.

865
02:00:49.338 --> 02:00:51.675
- Texas?
- He said he was going to Texas.

866
02:00:52.331 --> 02:00:54.152
I swear to God, he said he was
going to re-enlist.

867
02:00:54.283 --> 02:00:57.341
And he start talking of a property,
a decent piece of land...

868
02:00:57.884 --> 02:01:00.267
He's heading to Texas. I swear to god.

869
02:01:00.287 --> 02:01:01.357
Stay here.

870
02:01:04.580 --> 02:01:05.830
Fitzgerald.

871
02:01:07.511 --> 02:01:09.061
Fitzgerald.

872
02:01:37.944 --> 02:01:39.008
God dammit.

873
02:01:42.288 --> 02:01:43.471
God dammit.

874
02:01:48.133 --> 02:01:49.352
Open the gate.

875
02:01:49.837 --> 02:01:50.992
Open her up.

876
02:01:53.573 --> 02:01:54.881
Search Captain.

877
02:02:01.082 --> 02:02:03.392
Get him to the doctor, now.

878
02:02:04.860 --> 02:02:06.298
You said he was dead.

879
02:02:07.258 --> 02:02:09.688
- You said he was dead.
- I thought he was dead, I swear.

880
02:02:12.028 --> 02:02:13.632
- You're a liar.
- He lied to me.

881
02:02:13.653 --> 02:02:16.956
Liar, you left. You left him out there.

882
02:02:17.089 --> 02:02:19.439
- I thought he was...
- Say the Lord's prayer.

883
02:02:19.477 --> 02:02:22.032
- What?
- Say the Lord's prayer.

884
02:02:23.324 --> 02:02:24.840
Our father...

885
02:02:24.948 --> 02:02:27.940
Who art in heaven... I can't...

886
02:02:28.041 --> 02:02:28.772
Shut up.

887
02:02:28.894 --> 02:02:32.300
Shut up! From here on you are a prisoner
charged with treason.

888
02:02:33.016 --> 02:02:35.678
Take him to the cage. Take him to the cage!

889
02:02:35.705 --> 02:02:37.196
You handle or I'll shoot him!

890
02:02:38.252 --> 02:02:39.819
I thought he was gonna die.

891
02:02:40.710 --> 02:02:42.951
- Get up.
- Doc.

892
02:02:44.342 --> 02:02:45.938
I could help, please.

893
02:02:46.952 --> 02:02:49.387
- Please Captain...
- God!

894
02:02:50.592 --> 02:02:51.904
Alright. Come on.

895
02:03:00.744 --> 02:03:02.221
1, 2, 3.

896
02:03:02.256 --> 02:03:03.900
Slide, slide. Slide.

897
02:03:23.092 --> 02:03:25.389
- How is he?
- He'll be fine, but there is swelling...

898
02:03:25.660 --> 02:03:26.569
needs to rest.

899
02:03:27.101 --> 02:03:28.418
I'll be back to check up on him.

900
02:03:38.315 --> 02:03:40.154
He ran off, didn't he?

901
02:03:49.037 --> 02:03:51.142
Bridger is telling the truth...

902
02:03:53.438 --> 02:03:57.159
- How is that?
- Fitzgerald lied to him...

903
02:03:57.343 --> 02:03:59.004
He was just following orders.

904
02:04:01.172 --> 02:04:04.646
He wasn't there when Fitzgerald stabbed
my boy to death.

905
02:04:08.839 --> 02:04:13.775
Is that what happened?
He killed Hawk?

906
02:04:18.496 --> 02:04:19.870
I need a horse and a gun.

907
02:04:19.905 --> 02:04:21.980
- No, you need to rest
and something to eat.

908
02:04:22.379 --> 02:04:24.296
- I'm going after him.
- No.

909
02:04:25.858 --> 02:04:30.752
- You'll never find him without me.
- If we wait till morning he'll have a day head start and he get away.

910
02:04:30.915 --> 02:04:32.312
No he won't.

911
02:04:33.682 --> 02:04:35.077
He's afraid.

912
02:04:36.690 --> 02:04:38.936
He knows how far I came for him.

913
02:04:40.374 --> 02:04:44.721
Same as that elk, when they get afraid
they run deep in to the woods...

914
02:04:45.807 --> 02:04:47.558
I got him trapped, he just...

915
02:04:48.323 --> 02:04:51.481
- He doesn't know it yet.
- How can you be so sure?

916
02:04:52.863 --> 02:04:54.993
Cause he got everything to lose.

917
02:04:57.375 --> 02:05:00.088
All I had was that boy...

918
02:05:01.216 --> 02:05:02.943
And he took him from me.

919
02:05:07.006 --> 02:05:08.872
I can't let you go back out there.

920
02:05:09.403 --> 02:05:12.573
- Not again.
- No.

921
02:05:14.321 --> 02:05:16.476
I ain't afraid to die anymore.

922
02:05:18.803 --> 02:05:20.342
I've done that already.

923
02:05:26.335 --> 02:05:27.885
I'm going with you.

924
02:06:43.682 --> 02:06:46.412
It's his horse, alright. Yeah.

925
02:06:48.325 --> 02:06:50.200
No way he could have ridden
through the night.

926
02:06:50.791 --> 02:06:52.159
How far ahead?

927
02:06:53.091 --> 02:06:56.658
- Half a day at the most.
- Could be Ree.

928
02:06:57.767 --> 02:06:59.228
If they aren't his, we lose him.

929
02:07:00.510 --> 02:07:03.713
He must get re-enlisted so he can
justify killing again.

930
02:07:04.714 --> 02:07:06.422
This tracks right here are his.

931
02:07:08.547 --> 02:07:09.654
Come on.

932
02:07:16.659 --> 02:07:18.888
I can't remember my wife's face.

933
02:07:19.997 --> 02:07:22.208
Last week she was still with me.

934
02:07:24.183 --> 02:07:25.543
Now she's gone.

935
02:07:28.943 --> 02:07:32.022
I worry I won't recognize her
when I get back home.

936
02:07:44.700 --> 02:07:46.431
Is it true you killed an officer?

937
02:07:51.346 --> 02:07:54.520
I just killed a man who was
trying to kill my son.

938
02:08:13.449 --> 02:08:16.972
- Smoke.
- How close?

939
02:08:22.399 --> 02:08:24.285
No more than a mile up that way.

940
02:08:25.036 --> 02:08:27.984
I'm gonna head up to the west
you go down to the east...

941
02:08:28.412 --> 02:08:32.849
- See if we can find some tracks.
- What if it's the Ree?

942
02:08:33.944 --> 02:08:37.604
If it's the Ree, you turn right back around
and meet me back here.

943
02:10:03.063 --> 02:10:04.088
Hey!

944
02:10:06.284 --> 02:10:08.442
I wouldn't expect to find
a man of your stature...

945
02:10:09.381 --> 02:10:11.218
so far away from his stove when...

946
02:10:11.253 --> 02:10:13.539
the morning is so cold as this.
Captain, are you lost?

947
02:10:14.126 --> 02:10:16.268
I'm here to take you back to Fort Kahowa.

948
02:10:16.930 --> 02:10:18.740
Where you will be trialed for murder.

949
02:10:19.303 --> 02:10:20.520
Yes sir?

950
02:10:20.980 --> 02:10:23.121
I ain't crazy about your plan.

951
02:10:23.725 --> 02:10:25.553
Besides, I got one of my own.

952
02:17:54.261 --> 02:17:56.303
We had a deal Glass.

953
02:18:00.178 --> 02:18:02.330
I tried to tell your boy, alright?

954
02:18:02.481 --> 02:18:05.510
I tried to tell him what was happening,
but he won't listen...

955
02:18:05.558 --> 02:18:09.340
And he kept on screaming. And he was
gonna get everybody killed.

956
02:18:11.634 --> 02:18:12.727
You and me...

957
02:18:13.153 --> 02:18:14.374
we had a deal.

958
02:18:16.585 --> 02:18:18.242
We all know what happened out there.

959
02:18:19.362 --> 02:18:21.322
And on my soul to Lord.

960
02:18:21.429 --> 02:18:23.787
Lord he knows what happened out there.

961
02:18:27.082 --> 02:18:28.594
There was no deal.

962
02:18:31.818 --> 02:18:33.392
You killed my boy.

963
02:18:37.270 --> 02:18:39.176
Maybe you should have raised a man...

964
02:18:39.377 --> 02:18:41.526
Instead of a some girlie little bitch.

965
02:18:52.987 --> 02:18:54.514
God dammit!

966
02:21:18.005 --> 02:21:21.159
You came all this way
just for your revenge?

967
02:21:24.726 --> 02:21:26.108
Well you enjoy it Glass.

968
02:21:27.383 --> 02:21:30.284
Cause there ain't nothing gonna bring
your boy back.

969
02:21:53.838 --> 02:22:01.285
Revenge is in God's hands...

970
02:22:01.529 --> 02:22:03.128
not mine.

971
02:22:03.152 --> 02:22:19.152
