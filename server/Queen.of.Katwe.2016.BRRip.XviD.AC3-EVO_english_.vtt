1
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.690
Am I ready?

2
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.962
You belong here.

3
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.922
- Morning, Mrs. Kimbale.
- Morning!

4
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.404
Brian, still sleeping.

5
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.800
Phiona.

6
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.360
Richard! My little brother, get up!

7
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.005
It's only one. It's 500 each.

8
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.446
All five?

9
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.121
- All five?
- Yeah.

10
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.645
2,500.

11
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.131
Hey, when you want bargain?

12
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.321
Sir, pay me 1,000.

13
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.851
Two bags! Two bags! Two bags, please.

14
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.560
Your mother still owes me some money.

15
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.005
We'll make it up tomorrow.

16
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.650
That's it. Now, tell your mother

17
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.211
I need my money.

18
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.004
Oh, my God, Phiona.

19
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.960
He rode me on his boda.

20
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.080
Latest model, Chinese roadster.

21
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.480
China! Yeah!

22
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.400
Ask your sister why this man

23
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.130
takes young girls on his boda boda.

24
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.600
Mother asks, "Why does he
take young girls on his boda?"

25
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.409
Theo has a big heart!

26
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.007
Brian.

27
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.965
I think she should
keep this boy at a proper distance.

28
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.049
You must get 1,000, Phiona.

29
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.520
No, Mama, it's too much. I'm tired!

30
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.647
So am I.

31
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.411
Patricia's mother does not
force her to sell. I'm tired.

32
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.000
Patricia's mother has
a husband who is alive.

33
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.481
Did your father leave me
any money when he died?

34
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.441
Theo!

35
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.761
Night, where you going?

36
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.921
To get a ride.

37
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.363
Ah...

38
00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.170
Are you the mother or the sister?

39
00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.924
For you I'm not either.

40
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.724
And I know a hyena when I see it.

41
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.640
You keep away from my daughter.

42
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.760
Stop it, Mummy!

43
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.003
If I see you sniffing around here again...

44
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.889
I will burn this pile of tin to scrap!

45
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.127
You be careful.

46
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.726
This bike is worth
more than everything you have.

47
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.086
Theo.

48
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.247
Me, I'm gone.

49
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.361
Theo!

50
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.560
I will never forgive you for this.

51
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.200
I don't need your forgiveness!

52
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.727
I need you to sell maize
to feed your brothers!

53
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.481
Go.

54
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.921
Go!

55
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.730
Shirts. Shirts. Shirts is outside.

56
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.287
Shirts is out.

57
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.727
Come here. Shirts is outside you.

58
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.650
Spread out! Spread out!

59
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.849
Joseph! Long passes!
Keep playing, keep playing.

60
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.001
Katende.

61
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.209
They turned you down.

62
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.610
I warned you.

63
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.723
They don't care about your marks.

64
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.609
Only your family status.

65
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.049
I surrender, my friend.

66
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.365
I will accept the position
at your ministry...

67
00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.040
but only until I'm able to find

68
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.167
an engineering job.

69
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.244
What makes you think
I still have a job for you?

70
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.091
So, you would be willing
to restore hope...

71
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.489
and transform the lives
of children through sports.

72
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.324
Full time.

73
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.721
I would.

74
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.042
Welcome. Katwe needs you.

75
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.044
- One maca?
- Just 300.

76
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.451
I said, no, thank you. Gosh!

77
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.881
Thank you. Keep dancing. Keep dancing.

78
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.121
Thank you, madam.

79
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.371
Take my bucket, Phiona.

80
00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.680
Where do you go every day?

81
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.761
Ah!

82
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.887
Brian!
We haven't made 1,000 shillings yet!

83
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.041
Mmm-hmm.

84
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.646
Let's go!

85
00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.010
Go! Go! Go! Go!

86
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.045
Why aren't you taking part?

87
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.564
You can break bones playing football.

88
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.529
My mother refuses.

89
00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.409
No money for doctors.

90
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.043
Me, I have broken a few bones
playing football myself.

91
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.441
Joseph, what did I just say?

92
00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.888
There's another game you can play.

93
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.567
Have you heard of chess?

94
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.721
Me, I know.

95
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.280
You kiss a person and try to catch them.

96
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.971
No. It is a board game.

97
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.485
I can teach you.

98
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.971
I don't want.

99
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.521
Too bad, eh?

100
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.207
I thought you might like
beating city boys.

101
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.527
What do you mean?

102
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.800
When I was at school, the city boys
with their gold watches,

103
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:20.961
they loved this game.

104
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.566
They had contests to see who was the best.

105
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.926
I'm ready when you're ready.

106
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.211
Me, I was an orphan.

107
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.085
So, like you, I had no gold watch...

108
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.806
but I practiced my chess.

109
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.643
And I defeated them all.

110
00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.006
Thank you. I have tuition to pay.

111
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.486
Bring us this game.

112
00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.161
You want to play chess?

113
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.721
Good.

114
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.528
Hey, Floris

115
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.330
How are you, Floris?

116
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.331
- Morning.
- Morning, Brian.

117
00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.560
- Morning.
- Morning, Brian.

118
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.640
Morning. Morning, guys!

119
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.324
- Hi, Gloria.
- Morning.

120
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.050
- Joseph, hi.
- Morning, Ivan.

121
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.964
Hey, here comes Coach.

122
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.769
Good morning, Pioneers!

123
00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.524
Good morning, Coach!

124
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.164
Where are the cups?

125
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.845
Come for porridge!

126
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.001
Young girl.

127
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.087
Come.

128
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.723
Come inside. Come.

129
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.611
Are you hungry?

130
00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.040
Ugh!

131
00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.120
You smell!

132
00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.201
Who is that girl?

133
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.282
Have you been running in mud like a pig?

134
00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.646
Go away, smelly girl.

135
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.245
This is not your game.

136
00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.722
Let go!

137
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.640
Let go! Let go!

138
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.200
Next time I will tear that fat nose

139
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.520
right off your head!

140
00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.682
Who else is brave?

141
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.042
Me, I'm not brave.

142
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.486
Hey! A fighter.

143
00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.880
- What is your name?
- Phiona.

144
00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.961
Welcome.

145
00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.203
This is a place for fighters.

146
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.045
Phiona.

147
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.245
I will take these rotten ones
from yesterday...

148
00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.641
but you should be
giving them to me for free.

149
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.240
I'll give you something for free

150
00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.731
when you give me something for free.

151
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.881
Here.

152
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.727
No charge.

153
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.002
Abdul, go and play Ruwenda.

154
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.927
Gloria, would you please show Phiona

155
00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.371
how to move the pieces.

156
00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.440
Mmm...

157
00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.807
We must be merciful to the wicked.

158
00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.921
Hmm?

159
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.091
This is little man.

160
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.640
His boda is broken,

161
00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.131
so he can only bump into things.

162
00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.570
Beep, beep, beep.

163
00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.041
This is the queen.

164
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.726
She is the most powerful
of all the pieces.

165
00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.171
What do they all do?

166
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.725
They kill each other.

167
00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.882
See, dead.

168
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.487
This is the president.

169
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.442
If your president is trapped,
nowhere to go...

170
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.648
you say, checkmate.

171
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.926
Checkmate.

172
00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.970
Now, go away. I don't like your bad smell.

173
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.367
Hey, Phiona! How is your life?

174
00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.646
It is fine.

175
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.405
Oh, Lord, bless the food
we are going to eat. Amen.

176
00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.607
Amen.

177
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.370
Mom, I'm satisfied.

178
00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.769
You have my share, Mom.

179
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.843
I'm satisfied, Mom.

180
00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.844
You have eaten.

181
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.445
How?

182
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.525
Hmm...

183
00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.405
You better not be eating the maize.

184
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.970
Yes! Yes, I beat you.

185
00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.606
Aha! The pig has had a bath.

186
00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.648
Joseph, you're playing with fire.

187
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.881
Quiet, Benjamin.

188
00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.166
Coach.

189
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.610
Coach calls it promoting.

190
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.731
But I call it queening.

191
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.924
When you scoot little man
down the board...

192
00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.526
square by square...

193
00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.449
when he reaches the back rank...

194
00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.930
he becomes...

195
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.280
Mmm?

196
00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.010
...a queen.

197
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.640
In chess...

198
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.771
the small one can become the big one.

199
00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.968
That's why I like it.

200
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.767
Hmm.

201
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.601
You take care of Richard.

202
00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.762
I'm going to find Night.

203
00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.161
Phiona!

204
00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.889
- Phiona!
- Mmm?

205
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.609
- Night.
- Come.

206
00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.121
Night?

207
00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.200
Mother just went to look for you.

208
00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.246
Here.

209
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.004
Where did you get this?

210
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.367
I told you. Theo is kind hearted.

211
00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.491
You are not staying with him,
are you, Night?

212
00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.082
Mother stayed with a man.
In a few years, so shall you.

213
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.760
No, no, no. Not me.

214
00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.251
Night...

215
00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.884
do you think God wants bad fortune for us?

216
00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.405
Why would you say this?

217
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.283
Because since Papa and Juliet
passed away...

218
00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.920
it seems he is angry with us.

219
00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.880
I don't think God cares about us,

220
00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.450
one way or the other.

221
00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.161
Bye, my sister.

222
00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.562
Ivan, when you fetch water
for your mother...

223
00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.688
do you just go any time of the day?

224
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.251
Or do you think a bit first?

225
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.642
- I think a bit.
- About what?

226
00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.320
There are long lines
for water in the morning,

227
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.760
so I plan when I will go.

228
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.280
Ah! A plan.

229
00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.200
And I cannot arrive too late because

230
00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.930
I could get robbed on the way home.

231
00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.400
So, on my way,

232
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.005
I cut through the valley to save time.

233
00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.531
And what happens when the rain comes?

234
00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.080
The waters come down the hill.

235
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.280
And do you get washed away?

236
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.000
No, I climb in my hammock.

237
00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.242
Your hammock! Good plan.

238
00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.445
Threats from many directions.

239
00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:36.881
Robbers.

240
00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.166
Angry property owners.

241
00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.161
Floods.

242
00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.644
And other dangers.

243
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.763
How can this bishop survive?

244
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.687
Coach, no way.

245
00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.410
Eh, eh, eh. Look.

246
00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.769
Look at it closely.

247
00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.121
F-3?

248
00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.442
Yes, F-3.

249
00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.251
He is safe there.

250
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.368
Yes. In today's game...

251
00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:15.368
bishop is safe on F-3.

252
00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.888
When you first looked at this position...

253
00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.203
perhaps you thought there was
no safe haven for bishop.

254
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.691
But, you looked closely.

255
00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.083
You analyzed the threats. You made a plan.

256
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.810
And bishop found safety, eh?

257
00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.685
Use your minds.

258
00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.760
Follow your plans.

259
00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.650
And you will all find safe squares.

260
00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:39.650
Me, teacher! Me, teacher! Me, teacher!

261
00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.643
Nearly two million years ago...

262
00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:46.124
East Africans were the first
to master the use of fire.

263
00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:50.365
So, were we the first to eat kikomando?

264
00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.280
- Hey.
- Hey.

265
00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.681
The beautiful Mrs. Katende.

266
00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.370
Hello.

267
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.927
Some days ago, this girl,
Phiona, came for the first time.

268
00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.889
She was not clean.

269
00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.404
Ivan and the boys teased her very badly.

270
00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.921
Ivan is not Mr. Clean himself.

271
00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.560
So? Did she run home?

272
00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.201
No. She stayed.

273
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.004
She came back all cleaned up.

274
00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.764
She is stubborn.

275
00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.200
Sounds like someone I know.

276
00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.200
Hi.

277
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:31.801
Oh!

278
00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.130
She needs new clothes.

279
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.965
I can get some from my sister.

280
00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.685
This ministry salary
is not enough for us, eh?

281
00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.084
It is okay for now.

282
00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.000
I did not come first in my university

283
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.206
for my wife to pay the rent.

284
00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.725
It is not okay.

285
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.729
She must have more certainty
than I did as a child.

286
00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.725
She doesn't live in the bush, Robert.

287
00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.803
There is no war now.

288
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.610
Dig, dig, dig.

289
00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.800
Digging to plant. Digging to eat.

290
00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.564
Digging graves.

291
00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.687
She must never have to dig as I did.

292
00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.806
Checkmate.

293
00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.570
How'd you do that?

294
00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.688
You will never beat me, sister.

295
00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.161
Mmm-hmm.

296
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.611
East African Sewerage Company.
Good morning.

297
00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.489
Who is your family?

298
00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:17.921
Would I know them?

299
00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.761
I lost them at a young age, sir.

300
00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.160
Ah, sorry.

301
00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.080
Nevertheless, you had the highest grades

302
00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.730
in your IT class.

303
00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.850
You are highly qualified.
And honest, it seems.

304
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.001
Yes, sir.

305
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.320
I must warn you, a man with integrity

306
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.481
in a water company...

307
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.960
is as rare as a white rhino.

308
00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.561
I need someone like you.

309
00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.888
Give me some time to find an opening.

310
00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.328
But we are going to get you in here.

311
00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.526
Joseph, why are you letting her win?

312
00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.011
I'm not letting her!

313
00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.969
She won your bishop.

314
00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:11.849
What I'm seeing cannot be true.

315
00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:25.761
Ah!

316
00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:36.241
Huh?

317
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:41.921
Checkmate!

318
00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.844
She won! She won!

319
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Phiona has won!

320
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.162
Hey, Joseph, you are not serious?

321
00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.120
A girl has given you checkmate.

322
00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.406
Yeah. What?

323
00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.531
Sorry. I'm just a lucky beginner.

324
00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.365
I will never, ever play you again.

325
00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:06.841
Phiona.

326
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.326
Where did you learn those end moves?

327
00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.050
Did you look at one of my books here?

328
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.010
Me, I don't know how to read books.

329
00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.441
Hmm.

330
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:23.806
So, you just reasoned out
that end position on your own?

331
00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.005
Coach.

332
00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.969
When shall we play other children?

333
00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.282
Ivan is here. Play him.

334
00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.125
We want to play other boys.
The ones you talked of.

335
00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:35.765
City boys.

336
00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.605
City boys, eh?

337
00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.081
Sir.

338
00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.047
I already sent him away once.

339
00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.330
But he came back.

340
00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.410
Okay, send him in.

341
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.806
Katende. Slum children?

342
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.684
No, no, no, no.

343
00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.401
We can't have that.

344
00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:28.925
Why not, sir?

345
00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.287
No, no. No.

346
00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.842
See, we hold
the Father Grimes Tournament...

347
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.809
at King's College.

348
00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.131
At Budo.

349
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.367
It's a very clean and formal place.

350
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.810
But their skill levels
are improving very fast.

351
00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:46.961
And I'm sure that...

352
00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.081
Not their skill.

353
00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.401
No, no.

354
00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.762
We have a dinner.

355
00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.445
It is a tournament. Correct?

356
00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:55.561
Ah...

357
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.006
I'm a visitor at the Budo campus.

358
00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:02.124
I cannot bring a disease into this school.

359
00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.408
My children do not have diseases.

360
00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:07.404
That we know of. That we know of.

361
00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.643
No, no, no. No, no. I'm sorry. No!

362
00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.768
You have many "noes", Mr. Chairman.

363
00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.122
I wish to turn your "noes"
into "yeses", huh?

364
00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.130
But they're not in school. Correct?

365
00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.482
It is true that most of our children

366
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:24.726
cannot afford school.

367
00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.121
This is a school tournament. See?

368
00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.046
For schools.

369
00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.729
Cannot my Katwe players
come as guest participants?

370
00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.281
Yet, the fees.

371
00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.887
It's 4,000 shillings per child.

372
00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:41.530
Your children could afford this?

373
00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.366
Likely not.

374
00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.520
- I understand.
- Ah.

375
00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.125
Thank you for your efforts.

376
00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.200
And I thank you for committing to me
that if I raise the money for their fees...

377
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.000
you will admit the Katwe children
into the Father Grimes Tournament.

378
00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.161
Thank you, sir.

379
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.320
Mr. Katende...

380
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.401
Eesh!

381
00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.126
Coach!

382
00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.811
- The other 5,000.
- Perfect.

383
00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:25.928
Go get the others! Go!

384
00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.849
Yes! Go, Coach!

385
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.081
Coach!

386
00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.690
Coach, yes! Yes!

387
00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.720
Oh!

388
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.568
Coach! Yes, Coach!

389
00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.449
Go, Coach! Go!

390
00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:23.851
That was for Budo! Budo! Budo! Budo!

391
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.571
Yes! We are going to Budo!

392
00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.688
Budo! Budo! Budo!

393
00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.241
Fees!

394
00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.121
No, no, no. Please, no.

395
00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.361
Yes, yes, yes, please.

396
00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:38.881
Yes.

397
00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.011
Sorry, sir.

398
00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.361
Eh!

399
00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:54.084
Katende, are you playing
football for money again?

400
00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.640
Hmm?

401
00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.484
Do you want to aggravate your old injury?

402
00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:00.410
Now you're getting me angry.

403
00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.641
Sarah, I'm sorry.

404
00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.360
I couldn't tell the children

405
00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.568
we don't have the fees for Budo, eh?

406
00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.569
I just couldn't.

407
00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.443
Sorry, sorry, eh?

408
00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.561
Hmm.

409
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.365
Am I denied?

410
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.806
What did I say when I proposed to you, eh?

411
00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:19.961
Not this again.

412
00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.771
"Give me ten reasons to
marry you," the woman said.

413
00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.046
And what did I say?

414
00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:28.322
Reason one. "I love you."

415
00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:33.210
Reason two. Do you remember it?

416
00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.566
Yes, Robert.

417
00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.203
"I love you."

418
00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.241
- Eh?
- Hmm.

419
00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.969
Reason three.

420
00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.483
Shall I remind you of the rest?

421
00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.840
I am such a lucky woman.

422
00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:53.921
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

423
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.640
- Ah! My neck.
- Mmm?

424
00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:05.926
I'm just joking.

425
00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.608
Where do they go every day?

426
00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.000
You should be careful.

427
00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.685
They are just selling their maize.

428
00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.920
Me, I know. Those gamblers

429
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.082
give children porridge in the valley.

430
00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:29.244
Who knows how they'll use your children.

431
00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.120
Mmm-hmm.

432
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.725
Benjamin, play.

433
00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.201
Ha!

434
00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:27.921
Checkmate.

435
00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:32.521
What?

436
00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.481
No.

437
00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.205
This is not possible.

438
00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.411
We have a new champion.

439
00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.641
Well done, Phiona.

440
00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.721
Let me go back to my board.

441
00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:54.841
Well done.

442
00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:02.761
Benjamin.

443
00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.321
Ah!

444
00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.960
You are too mature for such tears, ah?

445
00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:09.000
But I was champion.

446
00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.206
Oh.

447
00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.209
You will be champion again.

448
00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:27.041
Hey!

449
00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.168
Hey! Madam! Madam! Madam!

450
00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:31.960
Hey!

451
00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.800
These children are not helpers
for your gambling games!

452
00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:35.880
Madam, you misunderstand our work.

453
00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:37.166
I know the work you men do.

454
00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.400
Let me explain.

455
00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:41.560
If I find my children here again, eh!

456
00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:42.926
You will see me.

457
00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.329
Phiona's in trouble.

458
00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.885
Phiona!

459
00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:12.641
Mmm.

460
00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:16.088
Coach! Mama, Coach!

461
00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:20.123
Coach! Coach!

462
00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.642
Madam, may I speak with you?

463
00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.526
It will only take a moment.

464
00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.846
Mama, please. Talk to Coach.

465
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.331
Just a moment, eh?

466
00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.881
Coach will take us to King's College.

467
00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.445
Yes!

468
00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:47.601
Chess is not gambling.

469
00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:48.767
Hmm...

470
00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.008
It is a game of kings and queens.

471
00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.367
It teaches discipline and mental strength.

472
00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.010
Work also teaches these things.

473
00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:57.440
But Nnyabo, this is a chance for them

474
00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:59.488
to visit the finest school in the country.

475
00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.250
How can I pay school fees?

476
00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.925
No need for that now.

477
00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:06.402
Your children are very vital to our group.

478
00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.604
Brian is full of determination.

479
00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.764
But, your daughter,
her intelligence is very high.

480
00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.400
Perhaps the highest among all my children.

481
00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:17.688
This opportunity could be
very valuable to her.

482
00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:21.969
Allow your children to come
with us to King's College...

483
00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:25.483
and I will find a way
for them to enter school, eh?

484
00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:27.005
You speak no sense.

485
00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.451
Let them come...

486
00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.600
and when we return,

487
00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:32.290
I will put them in private classes
with the best teacher in Kampala.

488
00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:37.965
Please, madam, eh?

489
00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:44.171
I am allowing them.

490
00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.527
If you do not keep your promise...

491
00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:48.200
you will never see my children again.

492
00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.880
Okay.

493
00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:50.960
- Yes!
- Thank you, madam.

494
00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.040
Mama, we are forever grateful!

495
00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:53.451
Thank you.

496
00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:55.761
- Thank you, Coach!
- We go to Budo!

497
00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:57.040
Let's go! Budo! Budo!

498
00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.121
Thank you, madam.

499
00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:33.561
Chicken.

500
00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.246
Hello.

501
00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:24.920
Hello. How are you?

502
00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:26.411
Come. Come, Pioneers.

503
00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:29.721
Hello.

504
00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:32.121
Welcome.

505
00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.686
Oh...

506
00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.961
Mr. Barumba, good morning.

507
00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.249
We are drawn together...

508
00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:06.450
by our love for this game of strategy...

509
00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.725
which strengthens our minds...

510
00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.249
and prepares us for our...

511
00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.801
Put it down. Brian, put it down.

512
00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:16.721
Ah!

513
00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:21.362
We welcome, also, some...

514
00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.083
underprivileged children.

515
00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:28.962
I'm sure we can show them
an example of good manners...

516
00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:33.648
to take back with them
to their communities.

517
00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.962
Now, eat and enjoy.

518
00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.690
Cheers!

519
00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:41.921
Okay, okay, okay.

520
00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.161
Not the...

521
00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.328
Use the knife.

522
00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.440
Gloria, pass me a glass.

523
00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:52.961
Ah!

524
00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.967
Good night, my Pioneers.

525
00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:51.326
Good morning, Pioneers!

526
00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.600
Good morning, Coach.

527
00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.684
I want to go home!

528
00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.680
Benjamin.

529
00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.289
Okay, okay, okay. Breathe, breathe!

530
00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.602
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

531
00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.171
I want my mum.

532
00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:26.560
Gloria.

533
00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.085
I don't want to play.

534
00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:31.889
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

535
00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:42.040
On my way to the bus yesterday,

536
00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:43.610
I saw a skinny dog.

537
00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.762
The dog was hungry.

538
00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.964
He spied a cat.

539
00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:52.010
Dog started to chase the cat
down the alley...

540
00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.487
through a puddle, through a house.

541
00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:57.405
Cat even jumped over a kettle fire! Ooh!

542
00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:01.240
And he was gone!
Dog collapsed on the floor.

543
00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:06.247
Tired! I said, "Dog, what happened, eh?

544
00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:09.802
"You were so hungry,
and your dinner got away."

545
00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:14.526
Dog said to me, "The problem is, me...

546
00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.362
"I was only running for a meal.

547
00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:20.320
"That cat was running for her life."

548
00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.844
You see, these children...

549
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.685
They have nice clothes, comfortable beds.

550
00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:32.526
They are like Dog.
Everything comes very easy.

551
00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.489
But you...

552
00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.960
my great cats, eh?

553
00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:41.250
You are running...

554
00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:45.811
for your lives. Eh?

555
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.082
Come, we pray.

556
00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:07.160
Dear Father, we thank you
for this opportunity.

557
00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:11.320
Help us to be great today. Amen.

558
00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.401
Amen.

559
00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:13.766
Come, we go.

560
00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:54.446
Coach, I cannot.

561
00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:56.850
He is the best one.

562
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.162
One of us has to play this board.

563
00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:00.685
Why not you?

564
00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:19.242
Welcome to the Father Grimes...

565
00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:23.086
National Schools Chess Championship.

566
00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.208
Commence play, please.

567
00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:43.520
Our Father, who art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name.

568
00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:46.160
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done on earth.

569
00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.211
Call it a draw?

570
00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.606
No.

571
00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:48.323
Sharp eye, little friend.

572
00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:51.720
I guess I've got a good fight
on my hands here.

573
00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:17.406
Do you have another lollipop?

574
00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.161
Mmm-mmm.

575
00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.131
Good strategy.

576
00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:29.801
Putting your weakest player
on the champion's board.

577
00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.410
Checkmate.

578
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:44.801
What?

579
00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:50.122
Coach! Me, I did it.

580
00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:51.361
Checkmate.

581
00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.481
Hmm?

582
00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:56.930
Benjamin. Well done.

583
00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:08.646
Benjamin!

584
00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:18.764
She's up two pawns on Pritchard.

585
00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:25.681
Checkmate.

586
00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:34.167
Coach!

587
00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.528
Gloria! What? What is it? What is it?

588
00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.523
He took my queen!

589
00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:40.880
Please...

590
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.206
He took my queen!

591
00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:43.850
- No!
- Okay, okay.

592
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.604
- He took my queen!
- Girl. Shh!

593
00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:48.768
- He took my queen!
- Please, please. Gloria!

594
00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:51.241
- He took my queen!
- Gloria! Shh!

595
00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:53.200
- My queen!
- Shh!

596
00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.006
Draw.

597
00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:10.123
- No.
- Draw!

598
00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:14.601
Ah!

599
00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:20.324
Pritchard! Pritchard! Pritchard!

600
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.729
None of your sneak attacks.

601
00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:42.723
This is not the ghetto.

602
00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.642
I don't need to sneak.

603
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.049
She surrounds you
until you have nowhere to go.

604
00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:15.891
And then squeezes you like a python.

605
00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:17.405
Checkmate.

606
00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:21.685
Such aggressiveness in a girl
is quite a treasure.

607
00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:28.040
As a member of the governing body

608
00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:29.804
of the Uganda Chess Federation...

609
00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.327
it is my honor to award a medal...

610
00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.404
to a girl who plays
with astonishing power.

611
00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:37.881
This year's Budoan gold medalist...

612
00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:42.000
is from the children's team
of Katwe, Phiona Mutesi.

613
00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:56.729
Children's team! Children's team!

614
00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:02.801
Yes!

615
00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:06.765
We won, yes!

616
00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:13.362
Coach, did that boy let me win?

617
00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:14.960
He did not let you win, Phiona.

618
00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.121
You defeated him.

619
00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:19.363
How could I win a boy
who goes to school here?

620
00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:21.887
You defeated him.

621
00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.361
Mmm?

622
00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.160
I think it's time for you to meet

623
00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:28.811
the best teacher in Kampala.

624
00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:34.849
Children's team! Children's team!

625
00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:58.769
I had no master teachers.

626
00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.730
These taught me to play.

627
00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:03.120
With books, it's like the teacher

628
00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:04.326
lives inside the pages...

629
00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:07.324
and you can visit them whenever you wish.

630
00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:09.084
Sarah loves books.

631
00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:12.847
I wish I could take all
the knowledge inside here...

632
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.048
and just put it in my head.

633
00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:20.090
Would you like to know
how to read this book?

634
00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.325
You see that?

635
00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:28.682
That is the word "chess."

636
00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:31.404
You play the game.

637
00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:33.528
Why not read the words?

638
00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:36.411
Each letter makes a sound.

639
00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:39.560
Your coach was hoping
we would become friends.

640
00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:41.847
I think that we will.

641
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.490
Have some tea.

642
00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:56.566
"Chess."

643
00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:12.850
Stop, stop, stop!

644
00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:22.966
Brian!

645
00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:26.645
Brian! My brother! Brian!

646
00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:28.484
Brother.

647
00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:32.361
Please help!

648
00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:35.840
Brother! Brother!

649
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.286
Please help!

650
00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:42.120
My brother is hurt!

651
00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:43.725
Can you take us to the hospital?

652
00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:46.810
- Mmm-mmm.
- I have money! I have money!

653
00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:54.080
Mama! Mama!

654
00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:56.128
Brian had an accident!

655
00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:02.801
- Mom.
- Ay.

656
00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:05.961
Shakira!

657
00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:08.410
- Take Richard.
- Okay.

658
00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:18.208
Your card in the hand, please.

659
00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:23.929
The wound goes from here to the bone.

660
00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:26.651
I can stitch him, but we have
no more pain medicine...

661
00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.245
and will not for another day.

662
00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:31.520
Another day?

663
00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:38.326
You stitch him.

664
00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.528
No, Mama. No!

665
00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:48.363
Mama!

666
00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:49.681
My God. Please.

667
00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:03.121
- Madam Harriet.
- Yes.

668
00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:05.360
I'll come to discuss your bill now now.

669
00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:06.805
No problem.

670
00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:11.560
- Richard.
- Mmm-hmm.

671
00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:13.688
You're the man remaining in our family.

672
00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:17.766
Me, I'm down.

673
00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:20.847
But I'm not out.

674
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.321
My son, can you walk?

675
00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:30.443
Take Richard.

676
00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:50.570
Put on your shoes.

677
00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:53.807
- Go. Take him.
- Where?

678
00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:55.041
Walk to the entrance.

679
00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.611
Go. Now, now, now.

680
00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:17.604
Oh! Hey.

681
00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:22.161
Sit here.

682
00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:25.681
Mrs. Kimbale.

683
00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:28.840
I will have 10,000,
or that door will not open.

684
00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:29.920
Of course.

685
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000
The money you earned.
I need it now now, Phiona.

686
00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:33.844
I gave it to the man on the boda boda.

687
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.161
You gave him our money!

688
00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:38.640
I had to! Because he would
not take Brian without it, Mama.

689
00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:42.650
If I were you, I would find a man.

690
00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:45.407
There are plenty of sugar daddies...

691
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.082
who'd want to pay your rent.

692
00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:50.726
That is not my business, Mrs. Kimbale.

693
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.047
Eh?

694
00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:55.689
Too superior, are we?

695
00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:57.410
Better than all of us?

696
00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:03.447
- Mrs. Kimbale.
- Take advantage of me...

697
00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:04.931
Mrs. Kimbale...

698
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:08.891
Brian was in the hospital!

699
00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:11.091
No rent.

700
00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:13.800
No house.

701
00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:18.649
Where will we go?

702
00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:24.280
I beg you, please! For my children!

703
00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:49.845
How much was it I take?

704
00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:54.680
Shut up, you drunkard. Shut up.

705
00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:34.809
Why did you go?

706
00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:46.891
You make our plan, Mama.

707
00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:49.801
Come.

708
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.889
Coach, there.

709
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.843
- Who is hungry, eh?
- Coach!

710
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.047
I don't want to eat alone.

711
00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:29.486
For you.

712
00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:31.842
Hey, my friend.

713
00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:34.363
You are back in action, eh?

714
00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:44.646
So, you told the others you are not
coming back to chess, eh?

715
00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:47.009
- Why?
- There are too many problems.

716
00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:49.811
But chess helps us
solve problems, isn't it?

717
00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.161
Brian.

718
00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:54.367
Set a game for you and I.

719
00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:13.721
Check.

720
00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:20.770
No, no. Phiona!

721
00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:22.763
Never tip your king so quick.

722
00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:26.329
Why not? When you're
going to be beaten anyway.

723
00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:27.481
Look.

724
00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:30.451
Focus on what you have.

725
00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:33.888
Coach, I think you don't come from here.

726
00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:39.842
When I was a child, my mother left me.

727
00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:44.160
In that moment I wanted to die.

728
00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:47.405
But it is a good thing
I did not take my life, eh?

729
00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:49.688
Otherwise I would not have
seen my daughter.

730
00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:52.286
I would not have met the Pioneers.

731
00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:54.247
Or you.

732
00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:55.447
Me?

733
00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:02.645
Do not be quick to tip your king, Phiona.

734
00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:05.365
You must never surrender.

735
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.001
Huh?

736
00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:28.241
Phiona.

737
00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:30.241
What are you doing?

738
00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:31.771
Playing my game.

739
00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:33.166
What game?

740
00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:36.843
Nothing, Mama. Just dreams.

741
00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:38.920
Theo, stop.

742
00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:42.326
Night!

743
00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:43.641
Phiona!

744
00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:48.125
Phiona.

745
00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:49.601
Oh, my God.

746
00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:50.966
Night.

747
00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:54.046
I came because I heard
that you were evicted.

748
00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:59.361
Why are you dressed...

749
00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:00.965
like a girl selling herself?

750
00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:03.209
Don't look if you don't like what you see.

751
00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:04.850
I can look away...

752
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.321
but God still sees what you do.

753
00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:09.491
Phiona, I'm going.

754
00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:10.886
Yes, you go.

755
00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:12.644
And make children you can't pay for.

756
00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:13.760
Like you did.

757
00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:15.808
Mama, don't fight her, please.

758
00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:17.485
Don't.

759
00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:19.121
Take this money, Phiona.

760
00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:23.687
Our mama is too proud to accept.

761
00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:26.561
Night?

762
00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:30.850
Can you please stay for a bit? Please?

763
00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:32.041
No.

764
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.243
Mom? You must take this money.

765
01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:04.841
For food.

766
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.287
Maybe even for a house.

767
01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.690
Can you accept?

768
01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.483
What happened to your king?

769
01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.000
He is under attack.

770
01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.401
Makes it difficult for him to castle.

771
01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:42.891
Hey! Hello, Brian.

772
01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.611
Hey! Welcome back.

773
01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:46.807
Abdul, bring.

774
01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.086
Phiona.

775
01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.924
Brian, have a seat, have a seat.

776
01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:51.246
Phiona, Phiona.

777
01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:52.441
Phiona.

778
01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:53.640
- Hello, Florence.
- Want some porridge?

779
01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:54.720
Have some porridge.

780
01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:56.480
- How are you?
- Nice to see you.

781
01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.130
- Nice to see you too, Coach.
- Welcome back.

782
01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:00.931
Have some porridge, come.
Come and play, okay?

783
01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.809
We're all together now, Pioneers.

784
01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.166
Commence play.

785
01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.485
Checkmate.

786
01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.646
Ivan, you're really good at math.

787
01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:02.730
Phiona, can you read that for me?

788
01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:06.642
- "A crocodile...
- Mmm-hmm.

789
01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.165
"...has many teeth."

790
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.082
But I did that in the middle game.

791
01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.485
Knight to G-5.

792
01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.687
Pawn to H-4.

793
01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:30.161
Pawn to C-3.

794
01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:42.410
Phiona, try as much as possible

795
01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:43.885
to avoid passive play.

796
01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:46.361
You allowed him to attack your castle.

797
01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:47.960
Your right squares were weak,

798
01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.611
and he capitalized on that
to capture your king.

799
01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:52.046
Checkmate.

800
01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:01.685
In tomorrow's game, make sure
you deny him a tempo...

801
01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:04.281
so he has to keep defending.

802
01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:28.048
Chess, it makes my brain sharp.

803
01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:41.489
- Checkmate.
- Yes.

804
01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:42.766
Yes!

805
01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.081
My great cats!

806
01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.125
You won a prize?

807
01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:47.520
For what?

808
01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:48.926
I won a boy.

809
01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:51.811
Best in boys, Phiona Mutesi.

810
01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.160
You won a boy?

811
01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:55.600
In fact, they named me best boy.

812
01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:17.364
Now, you know my plan
is to attack your B-5, yes?

813
01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:20.524
So you must bring your pawn
forward to defend. You see?

814
01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:26.967
Phiona, why are you developing over here?

815
01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.804
Your problem is on B-5.

816
01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:31.725
Look! I put my pawn on B-5,

817
01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:33.962
you take my pawn,
my knight attacks your queen,

818
01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.009
we exchange queens,
my knight attacks your king...

819
01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.685
I take your rook.

820
01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:41.647
With respect, Coach,
I would not move that way.

821
01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:42.801
You must.

822
01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:45.327
You are compelled by my position.

823
01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:01.848
If you come for my knight...

824
01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:04.168
I attack your king and take your rook.

825
01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:05.526
You see?

826
01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:15.682
You can see eight moves ahead?

827
01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:30.608
You could win at Rwabushenyi.

828
01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:33.444
You could be the best in all Uganda.

829
01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:36.206
Do you know what
that would mean for Katwe?

830
01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:38.683
Perhaps one day an international champion.

831
01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:41.366
Coach! Why are you shining me?

832
01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:42.521
Me, I'm not shining you.

833
01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:45.365
Only champions can see
that many variations.

834
01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:50.050
What is preventing you
from being a Grandmaster?

835
01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:53.090
I do not know about being a Grandmaster.

836
01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:55.761
Sometimes, the place you are used to
is not the place you belong.

837
01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.771
You belong where you believe you belong.

838
01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:03.769
Where is that for you, Phiona?

839
01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:07.566
Huh?

840
01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:17.409
Assisting these children
to attend school is a noble goal,

841
01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.971
but it's outside the mandate
of our ministry.

842
01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.730
That mandate should be changed.

843
01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:29.728
Katende, you do not speak any more

844
01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:33.288
like a man who has only a part-time job.

845
01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:35.169
These children have captured you.

846
01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.001
Mrs. Gali.

847
01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.844
Robert, good news!

848
01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:45.840
Your children are invited

849
01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:48.810
to the international chess
tournament in Sudan.

850
01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:51.930
Sudan? What is in the Sudan?

851
01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:54.000
Sudan is where the African children's

852
01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:55.650
chess tournament is held.

853
01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:58.610
Children from
all over Africa will be there.

854
01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.922
It is sponsored by the United Nations.

855
01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:04.601
Is it not far?

856
01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:05.921
A thousand miles away.

857
01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:09.124
That bus of yours would not get you there.

858
01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.691
I'm going to Sudan.

859
01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:13.129
There will be no bus this time.

860
01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:15.647
Phiona will travel by airplane

861
01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:19.003
with Ivan and Benjamin,
to represent Uganda.

862
01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:21.530
Think of that, eh?

863
01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:24.640
Katwe children, our children,

864
01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:25.960
representing the whole country.

865
01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:29.124
These two children are not "our" children.

866
01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:30.850
They are my children.

867
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.810
- Of course. I just meant...
- Me, I carried them in my body.

868
01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:35.166
Phiona is going in an airplane!

869
01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:36.961
Ah...

870
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.004
Richard, Phiona is going to Sudan.

871
01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:49.810
When they return...

872
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.525
I have arranged for Phiona and Brian

873
01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:53.320
to attend the school
where my wife teaches.

874
01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.440
Huh?

875
01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:55.646
On a scholarship.

876
01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:56.881
Eh?

877
01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.570
My wife has been teaching them to read.

878
01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:02.207
Yes! Yes, I know,
and I am grateful, but...

879
01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:04.841
But what?

880
01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:09.331
Isn't this what you wanted?
Education for your children?

881
01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.842
Yes, but how can I pay for uniforms?

882
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.360
How will I save?

883
01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:15.680
What time does school
begin in the morning?

884
01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:18.571
Your children can do more
than sell vegetables.

885
01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.760
They have a chance to go
beyond this kind of life,

886
01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:21.960
to go to school.

887
01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.680
Maybe one day attend university.

888
01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.286
Surely, you can understand
how important that is, eh?

889
01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:30.206
Hmm.

890
01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:34.603
I am not an educated woman, Mr. Katende.

891
01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:36.965
I understand nothing.

892
01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:56.960
You want to go to this Sudan?

893
01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:58.565
Yes, Mama.

894
01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:01.722
You stay always near your coach.

895
01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:03.924
You do not know
what people there are like.

896
01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:05.241
Mama, bye.

897
01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:07.200
- Yes, Lord...
- Bye, Mama Phiona.

898
01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:09.282
...I speak a blessing on my daughter.

899
01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:15.086
Our Father who art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name.

900
01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:17.242
Thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven.

901
01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:18.840
Give us this day our daily bread,

902
01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.001
and forgive us our...

903
01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:23.811
Bye, Benjamin.

904
01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.246
Bye, Phiona.

905
01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:27.164
Bye, Ivan.

906
01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:47.844
Coach, is this heaven?

907
01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:53.442
No. Heaven is a bit higher.

908
01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:05.726
I've never before seen an airport.

909
01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:08.886
I only have two sets of clothes.

910
01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:12.010
How am I going to win
these people over here?

911
01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.281
Benjamin!

912
01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:34.164
Benjamin, come. You also must practice.

913
01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:36.526
Go to Mozambique.

914
01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:40.207
Our coach trained in Moscow.
He's a Grandmaster.

915
01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:43.042
He teaches students in Russia.

916
01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:46.647
He almost beat Kasparov. Can you imagine?

917
01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:49.002
Coach said that if I become a master,

918
01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:51.606
I may receive a stipend
from our federation

919
01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:53.489
simply to go to tournaments.

920
01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:55.682
What is it, a stipend?

921
01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.569
What is it?

922
01:10:58.080 --> 01:10:59.760
Money, silly.

923
01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.410
Could I be a master?

924
01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:02.920
Eh?

925
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.004
First, you have to win 50% of your games

926
01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:08.288
in a FIDE approved tournament.

927
01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:10.727
Like the Olympiad, in Russia.

928
01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:13.724
- Have you ever heard of it?
- No.

929
01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.840
I'm beating this one.

930
01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:33.763
Mmm-mmm, I'm beating this one.

931
01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:48.969
You don't know much, do you?

932
01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:51.404
I know a bit.

933
01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:54.921
Checkmate.

934
01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:08.841
I won him.

935
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.604
I won my girl too.

936
01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:12.962
He's the best player.

937
01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:18.604
They must be tricking us.

938
01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:20.927
Coach?

939
01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:23.401
I think we can win them tomorrow.

940
01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:25.005
They are over.

941
01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:30.080
And third place, Kenya.

942
01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:35.640
Second place, Sudan.

943
01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:42.760
And first place, Uganda!

944
01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:46.681
Yes!

945
01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.120
We won! Yes!

946
01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:51.968
My Pioneers, you have won
an international tournament!

947
01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:58.730
Uganda, may God uphold Thee

948
01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:03.807
We lay our future in thy hand

949
01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:09.080
We used to eat
rice and beans in the village.

950
01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:10.889
Look at what we're eating now. Mmm, mmm!

951
01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:14.965
Ketchup is the greatest thing
that has ever been invented.

952
01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.891
I want a lake filled with ketchup.

953
01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:19.570
Ha! Ivan, you are funny.

954
01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:22.366
- Ketchup. Yes.
- Cheers.

955
01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:23.851
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

956
01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:32.170
Thank God!

957
01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:37.362
Thank God!

958
01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:39.727
They fed you?

959
01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:40.887
Yes, Mama.

960
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.321
Ah, I see you got another.

961
01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:45.325
Oh...

962
01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:47.680
I wish we could eat these prizes.

963
01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:49.000
You come.

964
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.445
What has happened?

965
01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:58.681
Theo got tired of her.

966
01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:02.120
She'll be fine. You come and sit.

967
01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.600
Brian.

968
01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:07.728
- Phiona.
- Richard.

969
01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.887
How does it feel to be in a plane?

970
01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:14.041
It is fine.

971
01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.800
How do you pee in a plane?

972
01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.921
They have rooms inside the plane

973
01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:21.280
with toilets in them.

974
01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:22.601
You let her rest.

975
01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:24.888
She's tired from her journey.

976
01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:27.962
I'm sure that Sudan does not have food

977
01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:31.960
as sweet as your mother's meat and matoke.

978
01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:57.447
Welcome home, Miss Uganda of chess.

979
01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:59.409
You are bringing with you
the grand trophy.

980
01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:01.244
Tell us how you did it.

981
01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:03.243
Chess is a game of fighting.

982
01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:07.486
Benjamin, Ivan, and me, we are from Katwe.

983
01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:08.926
We are fighters.

984
01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:10.969
With more tournaments around the corner,

985
01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:12.281
I'm sure we'll be hearing

986
01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:13.805
from these Katwe fighters very soon.

987
01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:17.169
But for now, we celebrate
this latest triumph.

988
01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:18.361
Phiona!

989
01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:22.603
Every time you bring home
one of those shiny trophies...

990
01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:24.489
I'll give you a new hairstyle.

991
01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:30.325
You said your project

992
01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:33.486
would make Phiona's character stronger.

993
01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.800
Since you took her to this Sudan,

994
01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:39.281
she refuses to do many of her tasks.

995
01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:41.044
- Wake up, Phiona.
- Mmm-mmm.

996
01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:42.964
Time to wash the cassava.

997
01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:46.280
It is improper for the tournament winner

998
01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:48.044
to wash cassava.

999
01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:50.649
Who should wash them then?

1000
01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:53.562
Those of us who are
not tournament winners?

1001
01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:55.961
We're the cassava washers? Is that it?

1002
01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:59.169
I am her mother.
And she should do as I say.

1003
01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:03.324
She believes your game will
solve every problem of her life.

1004
01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:07.804
Why not then let us wash your feet, madam?

1005
01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:11.571
When I was a girl...

1006
01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:13.640
I was told stories

1007
01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:16.320
of a village by the lake that
never runs short of maize.

1008
01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:17.440
Come back here!

1009
01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:19.727
Where there is no fighting.

1010
01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:23.324
I never found that place, Mr. Katende.

1011
01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:25.608
Your children deserve better.

1012
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.843
Enough food to eat.

1013
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.685
A roof over their heads. Safety.

1014
01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:33.844
You have shown
my children a paradise, yes.

1015
01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:36.846
But now they feel
out of place where they are.

1016
01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.608
That girl from Egypt
flies to Russia to see her coach.

1017
01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:44.366
She has her own computer to practice with.

1018
01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:47.364
She has biscuits. She has clothings.

1019
01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:49.204
Why does this suddenly bother you now?

1020
01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:50.725
Because I won that girl.

1021
01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:52.564
Coach, I won her!

1022
01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:54.960
They will not
be able to return to their old lives

1023
01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:57.042
because they have tasted yours.

1024
01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:00.886
Not here, not there. Like ghosts...

1025
01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:04.080
who cannot rest.

1026
01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:06.891
If that happens, Mr. Katende...

1027
01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:12.281
I will hold you responsible.

1028
01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:29.766
You're wearing your
determined face, Robert.

1029
01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:38.442
Phiona has the talent of a prodigy.

1030
01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:42.447
And me, I do not have the experience

1031
01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:44.164
to properly train her.

1032
01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:46.448
Why should she be denied
the glory of victory

1033
01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:48.324
just because she was born here?

1034
01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:02.921
Bishop captures B-8.

1035
01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:06.605
Put out the lamp, Phiona.

1036
01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:08.364
I have too much to learn.

1037
01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:10.648
You're going to finish our paraffin.

1038
01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:31.967
Mama, chess allows me porridge.

1039
01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:33.725
But for Phiona...

1040
01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:37.880
She has just learned,

1041
01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:40.122
yet she is trapping people on that board.

1042
01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:45.850
It is a good game about
escaping from this place.

1043
01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.490
Escape.

1044
01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:49.325
Hey!

1045
01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:53.323
To where? The villages?

1046
01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:58.009
I grew up there
and my stomach was always empty.

1047
01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:02.405
Mama, give Phiona at least chance.

1048
01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.484
Mr. Nagenda.

1049
01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:20.691
Eh... Harriet.

1050
01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:21.920
Hmm.

1051
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.047
You remember my name?

1052
01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:27.443
The only name from that
village worth remembering.

1053
01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:31.920
Eh...

1054
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.287
I heard you lost your husband.

1055
01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:35.441
Yes.

1056
01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:36.600
I'm sorry.

1057
01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:37.886
- Hmm.
- Mmm.

1058
01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:43.207
Have you remarried?

1059
01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:02.811
Let me take you to, uh, Calendar Hotel.

1060
01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:04.371
Eh?

1061
01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:07.041
For dinner.

1062
01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:11.651
They make excellent grilled meat.

1063
01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:16.760
It is not grilled meat I need today.

1064
01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:18.444
Hmm...

1065
01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:21.801
I have come to sell you this piece.

1066
01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:26.887
My mother gave it to me.

1067
01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:28.087
Then, um...

1068
01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:32.000
Then I'm sure its value to you would be

1069
01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:34.128
more than its value to me.

1070
01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:35.481
How much can you offer?

1071
01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:38.848
I don't want to insult you.

1072
01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:43.601
That would trouble me.

1073
01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:45.000
Sometimes...

1074
01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:48.929
we must take a risk,

1075
01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:52.166
mustn't we, Tendo?

1076
01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:58.367
Perhaps.

1077
01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:02.368
12,000 shillings.

1078
01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:04.366
Mmm-hmm?

1079
01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:07.404
You meant to say 15, didn't you?

1080
01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:09.961
No, I meant to say 100.

1081
01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:14.683
If it might win me your company...

1082
01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:17.086
over dinner.

1083
01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:28.286
The 12,000 will do.

1084
01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:33.723
- Mama...
- Hmm?

1085
01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:39.963
Has anyone from Katwe
become a city person?

1086
01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:47.324
Don't think about such things, Phiona.

1087
01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:50.491
Why not?

1088
01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:54.485
- Because if you do...
- Mmm-hmm.

1089
01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:00.970
...you will be disappointed.

1090
01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:02.565
- Mama...
- Mmm?

1091
01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:06.489
I will give you a house one day.

1092
01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:23.721
- Coach!
- Hey.

1093
01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:25.720
Phiona knows the moves I will play.

1094
01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:27.325
She is reading my mind.

1095
01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:33.880
Don't they call such people Masters?

1096
01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:35.610
Eh, Phiona, be humble.

1097
01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:38.161
Come on, Coach. Masters get stipends.

1098
01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:41.405
Yes, but you have to play
big people. Adults.

1099
01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:43.325
We will see.

1100
01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:46.768
The Chess Olympiad in Russia?

1101
01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:52.211
Phiona, we are all very,
very happy that you qualified.

1102
01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:56.361
The Ministry, all of us,
wish to support you, but...

1103
01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:59.808
Phiona, even if, between us,

1104
01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:02.884
we could somehow find the funds...

1105
01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:05.247
isn't this a bit premature?

1106
01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.925
Premature, yes. Yes.

1107
01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:18.206
If I score 50% at the Chess Olympiad...

1108
01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:20.961
I can qualify as a Master.

1109
01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:25.524
I want to be a Master

1110
01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:27.768
more than anything in the world.

1111
01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:31.242
It would be good for the Chess Federation

1112
01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:33.243
and for my family.

1113
01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:38.281
Welcome aboard.

1114
01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:41.451
Flying time from Moscow to Khanty-Mansiysk
will be 3 hours and 10 minutes.

1115
01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:44.560
We welcome all the Chess Olympiad teams
flying with us today. Spasibo.

1116
01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:46.961
Phiona, remember.

1117
01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:51.524
The middle-game tricks you like,
the sacrifices, the quick mates.

1118
01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:54.969
Without good pawn structures,
much of this will be unavailable to you.

1119
01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:58.722
Why are you nervous, Coach?

1120
01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:01.526
The queen will help me to win.

1121
01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:04.604
Hey. Be careful of overconfidence, eh?

1122
01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:10.644
Slow it down, think it through...

1123
01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:14.690
then you will see the traps coming.

1124
01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:55.561
Welcome to Russia.

1125
01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:56.806
Thank you.

1126
01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:00.405
Welcome.

1127
01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:01.931
Thank you.

1128
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.048
Now is the time, Coach.

1129
01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:17.810
I will return everything
you have done for me.

1130
01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:20.361
For you and Mama, I'm going to win.

1131
01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:22.847
Don't think about that now, Phiona.

1132
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.764
One step at a time, eh?

1133
01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:27.489
I must win.

1134
01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:31.480
Coming to you live

1135
01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:33.050
from Khanty-Mansiysk, in Russia

1136
01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:36.210
where we are presenting
our Chess Olympiad game.

1137
01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:38.886
This is the last round where Uganda

1138
01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.128
is being paired with Canada

1139
01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:43.560
and we are having the Uganda young star,

1140
01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:44.926
14-year-old Phiona Mutesi

1141
01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:46.445
who's leading her team.

1142
01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:49.126
Seeing this youngest girl
representing the country

1143
01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:50.520
- for the first time ever.
- Go, Phiona!

1144
01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:52.245
This is history in the making.

1145
01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:53.925
I always believed in that girl.

1146
01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:57.004
Phiona looks a bit nervous,
but she's very bold.

1147
01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:27.121
Tight, tight game.

1148
01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:29.408
But the position is not very good for her.

1149
01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:31.920
Kagramanov has a bit advantage for now,

1150
01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.162
but Phiona is still hanging in there.

1151
01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:02.088
Oh, no. Oh, no. Yeah, she's resigned.

1152
01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:03.730
I think she's giving up on the game.

1153
01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:07.444
I think this is too much
for a 14-year-old.

1154
01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:54.610
Phiona. Phiona! Phiona!

1155
01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:57.442
I told you, never leave the group, eh?

1156
01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.764
I will never be a Master.

1157
01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:02.082
I will never be good enough.

1158
01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:03.920
And you knew it, Coach.

1159
01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:12.967
I sell maize, Coach. I sell maize!

1160
01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:15.248
I know how to do that.

1161
01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:16.640
But now you see me.

1162
01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:18.563
See how chess has disturbed me.

1163
01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:20.720
I will never belong to it!

1164
01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:23.041
And this will never be my place!

1165
01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:25.089
Phiona. Phiona.

1166
01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:28.210
Losing does not mean you're a failure.

1167
01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:30.324
It just takes time, that's all.

1168
01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:33.486
Stamina. Eh? That is the key.

1169
01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:36.484
I wish you had never taught me this game!

1170
01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:38.768
Phiona, Phiona.

1171
01:32:57.640 --> 01:33:00.405
Hey, Phiona! How is your life?

1172
01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:13.926
Robert Katende.

1173
01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:17.480
Mr. Katende, Wilson of
East Africa Sewerage on the line.

1174
01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:19.005
Oh, Mr. Wilson.

1175
01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:21.049
Finally, I have a position for you.

1176
01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:24.244
I can bring you in
as an engineering supervisor.

1177
01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:25.401
Supervisor?

1178
01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:29.042
I'm happy to offer you something that
will make a big difference in your life.

1179
01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:31.764
Ho!

1180
01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:33.887
Uh, Mr. Katende...

1181
01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:36.807
can I expect you Monday?

1182
01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:38.960
Uh...

1183
01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:42.400
Thank you. Thank you for the offer, sir.

1184
01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:43.880
Uh...

1185
01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:47.407
May I have a day
to discuss it with my family?

1186
01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:58.042
Phiona! Don't mind.

1187
01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:00.168
Next time you win that trophy, eh?

1188
01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:26.370
Coach...

1189
01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:30.811
You told us to make a plan
for when the rains came.

1190
01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:35.927
But how can I plan
when there is no roof...

1191
01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:38.447
I'll return later. Do you understand?

1192
01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:40.045
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

1193
01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:41.247
Bye, Richard.

1194
01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:50.405
...when there are no walls?

1195
01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:59.084
The water does not care about my plan.

1196
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.968
The water takes anything it wants.

1197
01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:05.600
Night! Night!

1198
01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:07.321
Night!

1199
01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:26.771
Brian! Brian!

1200
01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:29.006
Help me!

1201
01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:32.440
Help me!

1202
01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:39.325
- Richard!
- Richard!

1203
01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:40.811
Richard!

1204
01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:52.282
Mama, give me Richard.

1205
01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:54.680
You hold him!

1206
01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:57.531
Night! Night!

1207
01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:01.567
Tell me how I should have played, Coach.

1208
01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:12.561
Night!

1209
01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:15.681
You come with me!

1210
01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:17.410
I was coming back.

1211
01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:19.050
You were supposed to watch Richard!

1212
01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:20.207
Where were you?

1213
01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:22.362
I left only a few minutes. He was tied in.

1214
01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:25.888
Do not speak a word!

1215
01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:31.729
Mama! Put down my things!

1216
01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:33.689
Mama! Mama, I'm sorry!

1217
01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:35.046
Why? Why?

1218
01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:37.640
Have I not already lost one child?

1219
01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:40.405
Mama, I'm sorry!

1220
01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:41.931
Don't, Mama! Don't!

1221
01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:46.086
Mama, I'm pregnant.

1222
01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:49.567
What?

1223
01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:52.725
Hey...

1224
01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:06.924
Very soon, men will start coming after me.

1225
01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:11.761
Where is my safe square, Coach?

1226
01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:16.922
You are finding it.

1227
01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:20.766
You do not have to
travel down the same path as Night.

1228
01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:22.922
You have a chance to make your own.

1229
01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:25.730
And you are strong.

1230
01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:29.407
I fear certain things will never change.

1231
01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:31.520
You are the youngest ever player

1232
01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:33.807
to take Uganda to the Chess Olympiad.

1233
01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:36.287
Things are changing.

1234
01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:39.442
My life is the same.

1235
01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:40.601
Phiona.

1236
01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:54.126
My mother had me when she was
still in high school.

1237
01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:57.360
She couldn't even present me to my father

1238
01:37:57.440 --> 01:37:59.249
because he had another family

1239
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.651
so I was moved from aunty to aunty.

1240
01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:06.040
The first time I met my mother,

1241
01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:08.009
I was six years old.

1242
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.287
And I could hardly believe
she was the one.

1243
01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:14.531
I had always been called Katende.

1244
01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:16.967
She was the one who told me
my name was Robert.

1245
01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:20.687
Robert Katende, I'm your mother.

1246
01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:24.649
I stayed with her for two years.

1247
01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:29.525
And she became my everything.

1248
01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:37.328
Then, this one Saturday...

1249
01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:41.371
my grandmother came crying Mother's name.

1250
01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:44.965
And I knew, in that moment, that...

1251
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.843
Mama had died.

1252
01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:56.411
I lost her for a second time.

1253
01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:01.244
I, too, thought things could never change.

1254
01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:05.049
But they did.

1255
01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:08.091
Losses happen for all of us.

1256
01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:11.847
But what matters is
when you reset the pieces

1257
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.207
and play again.

1258
01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:17.045
Huh?

1259
01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:20.690
The Rwabushenyi Championship
is waiting for you.

1260
01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:23.366
One day, you'll be ready for it.

1261
01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:25.608
And then your life could change.

1262
01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:33.885
I don't want to go back
to my mother's place.

1263
01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:39.682
I want to stay here...

1264
01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:43.842
study and work on my chess.

1265
01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:46.881
Can I stay for some time?

1266
01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:51.407
Yes.

1267
01:39:57.760 --> 01:39:59.205
Yes, you can.

1268
01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:04.006
I will speak to your mother.

1269
01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:08.920
Is Phiona all right?

1270
01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:12.767
She will be staying with us for a while.

1271
01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:17.890
What is it, Robert?

1272
01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:22.288
I must let you know something.

1273
01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:27.641
Mr. Wilson, from East Africa
Sewerage called.

1274
01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:34.245
He finally offered me a job
as an engineering supervisor.

1275
01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:36.286
Good pay.

1276
01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:40.483
Much higher than what we now
receive from the Ministry.

1277
01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:45.291
I refused him.

1278
01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:48.529
I cannot leave the Pioneers.

1279
01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:52.801
This may make our lives more complicated.

1280
01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:54.161
Sorry for that.

1281
01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:55.805
Why do you do this?

1282
01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:03.047
Why are you sorry for doing
what you know is right?

1283
01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:05.650
I always knew you were the kind of person

1284
01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:08.883
who would give everything to
a purpose like the Pioneers.

1285
01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:12.489
That is your work.

1286
01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:16.563
And that is the work of this family.

1287
01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:49.285
Who can name all the countries in our
dearly beloved Africa?

1288
01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:51.602
Me, teacher! Me, teacher!

1289
01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:56.645
How about you, Phiona?

1290
01:41:57.680 --> 01:41:58.681
Do you know one?

1291
01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:01.800
Sudan?

1292
01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:04.042
Excellent. That's right.

1293
01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:06.521
Now please open your books
and write down for me

1294
01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:09.326
the names of three African countries.

1295
01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:18.044
Did you speak to Phiona?
When is she coming home?

1296
01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:19.565
She wishes to stay a bit longer

1297
01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:21.125
with Coach and his family.

1298
01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:47.206
Hey!

1299
01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:49.607
Mmm-hmm.

1300
01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:55.921
Checkmate.

1301
01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:57.764
- What?
- Madam Phiona.

1302
01:42:57.920 --> 01:42:59.001
Yes?

1303
01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:00.201
Are you a champion?

1304
01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:02.084
No, not yet.

1305
01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:05.050
Will you try at Rwabushenyi?

1306
01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:07.607
I don't think so. Maybe next year.

1307
01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:10.366
No, you must try this year!

1308
01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:12.761
Phiona, do it for us.

1309
01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:18.609
Checkmate!

1310
01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:23.120
You must consider
the other side of your board.

1311
01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:26.564
Nowadays you beat me so easily!

1312
01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:29.650
Me, I think strategy must
run in your blood, eh?

1313
01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:32.804
Did one of your ancestors
command a great army?

1314
01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:35.361
These pieces are my army.

1315
01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:37.483
- You must play at Rwabushenyi.
- Mmm.

1316
01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:39.802
It is the premier tournament
in the country.

1317
01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:42.281
You would be playing
international Masters.

1318
01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:43.880
Or do you fear losing?

1319
01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:49.725
Losing teaches me how to play better.

1320
01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:51.491
I will play.

1321
01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:55.767
I can see your mother's
strength in you, Phiona.

1322
01:43:56.160 --> 01:43:57.650
How is she?

1323
01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:05.847
If I could see my mother
for just one more time...

1324
01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:10.448
I would give everything
in my possession for that.

1325
01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:20.285
No customers today.

1326
01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:22.329
Ah, it's still early.

1327
01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:23.521
They will come.

1328
01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:42.280
Mom...

1329
01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:50.721
Are you my daughter?

1330
01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:52.609
Yes, Mom. I am.

1331
01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:00.050
Here, come. Sit, sit.

1332
01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:05.170
You are smart.

1333
01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:07.408
Thank you, Mom. Now I'm in school.

1334
01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:10.040
I know. I know.

1335
01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:14.404
Look, Richard. Phiona has come back.

1336
01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:15.561
Put it here.

1337
01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:19.320
- Mom.
- Huh?

1338
01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:21.323
- Coach is there.
- Where?

1339
01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:29.521
Thank you.

1340
01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:36.084
Bring the flavor to the fish

1341
01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:38.923
Bring the flavor to the rice

1342
01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:41.321
Yeah, the number one spice

1343
01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:43.844
Bring the flavor to the fish

1344
01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:45.567
Hello, Madam.

1345
01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:50.931
You give this to your wife from my family.

1346
01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:54.764
Please, please, no need
for that. Thank you.

1347
01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:57.442
You have done something remarkable.

1348
01:45:58.120 --> 01:45:59.849
You are speaking no sense again.

1349
01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:01.769
Your children are blessed

1350
01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:04.764
because they have a mother
who never gave up on them.

1351
01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:07.601
And you did it all alone.

1352
01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:09.603
Bring the flavor to the fish

1353
01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:11.450
Bring the flavor to the rice

1354
01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:13.760
Bring the flavor to the rice

1355
01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:16.722
I have tried for them.

1356
01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:18.281
Yeah.

1357
01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:20.369
Thank you.

1358
01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:33.481
Buy some.

1359
01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:35.606
Who's the number one spice?

1360
01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:37.640
Who's the number one spice?

1361
01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:38.961
- Sir...
- Even me!

1362
01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:40.605
- Spice!
- Mama!

1363
01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:44.481
- Please, sir.
- You're my spice.

1364
01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:45.560
Yeah!

1365
01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:49.008
Who's the number one spice?
Who's the number one spice?

1366
01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:51.806
Who's the number one spice?

1367
01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:54.809
Oh, Zesiro.

1368
01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:57.327
Phiona has to win that Championship.

1369
01:46:57.480 --> 01:46:58.527
But no problem.

1370
01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:00.483
If not, your daughter
will sell with my daughter.

1371
01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:04.520
No. My daughter will not be
selling in the market.

1372
01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:23.520
This is the final round

1373
01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:26.365
of our Rwabushenyi National
Chess Championship.

1374
01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:29.605
Phiona Mutesi and Christine Namaganda

1375
01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:32.240
are tied for first position
in the women's category.

1376
01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:35.762
They will now play
the final deciding game.

1377
01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:41.569
Commence play, please.

1378
01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:02.810
You belong here!

1379
01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:08.129
- You belong here.
- Silence.

1380
01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:10.806
Or move out.

1381
01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:12.850
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1382
01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:20.443
Yes! Yes!

1383
01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:23.206
What does it mean?

1384
01:51:23.360 --> 01:51:24.566
It means she's winning!

1385
01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:27.289
She's winning.

1386
01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:23.160
She queened the pawn!

1387
01:52:23.240 --> 01:52:25.561
- She queened the pawn!
- Yes, yes, yes!

1388
01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:47.080
Phiona.

1389
01:53:00.120 --> 01:53:02.805
Phiona! Phiona! Phiona!

1390
01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:06.163
Katwe! Katwe! Katwe!

1391
01:53:39.720 --> 01:53:41.085
Hold it up! Hold it up!

1392
01:53:45.920 --> 01:53:48.571
Katwe! Katwe! Katwe!

1393
01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:50.927
Madam! Madam!

1394
01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:52.491
- Come!
- Eh!

1395
01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:54.240
Mama!

1396
01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:11.080
Well done, madam.

1397
01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:42.200
Eh!

1398
01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:50.720
- Is this, uh, that Phiona?
- Mmm-hmm!

1399
01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:52.802
They made a book on her life story.

1400
01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:54.450
Was she paid for this?

1401
01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:55.726
Yes, she was.

1402
01:54:55.880 --> 01:54:57.166
Hmm!

1403
01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:09.643
No! You play over there.

1404
01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:13.603
- Brian!
- Mama! Mama, come!

1405
01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:15.480
Come!

1406
01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:18.006
Just come, Mama. Just come!

1407
01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:19.161
Wait, my sweater.

1408
01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:20.600
- You don't need, Mama.
- Mom.

1409
01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:21.841
Let's go.

1410
01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.287
- Where are we going?
- Just come!

1411
01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:28.687
- Where are you taking me?
- Mom, just enter. Just enter.

1412
01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:41.170
Where are you taking me in this motorcar?

1413
01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:42.685
Wait!

1414
01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:26.731
I can see that red thing for Mummy.

1415
01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:29.008
See that red shirt.

1416
01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:30.321
Red shirt.

1417
01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:39.041
Where are we?

1418
01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:45.170
We are home, Mama.

1419
01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:52.042
Home again
Home again

1420
01:57:54.160 --> 01:57:58.165
One day I know I'll feel home again

1421
01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:02.764
Born again
Born again

1422
01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:09.365
One day I know I'll feel strong again

1423
01:58:09.800 --> 01:58:11.520
I left my head

1424
01:58:17.480 --> 01:58:20.802
Many times I've been told

1425
01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:25.447
All this talk will make you old

1426
01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:28.886
So I close my eyes

1427
01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:31.931
Look behind

1428
01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:40.689
So I close my eyes

1429
01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:43.040
Look behind

1430
01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:45.202
Moving on

1431
01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:53.202
Lost again
Lost again

1432
01:58:55.880 --> 01:58:59.771
One day I know our paths will cross again

1433
01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:04.402
Smile again
Smile again

1434
01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:10.565
One day I hope to make you smile again

1435
01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:13.041
I won't hide

1436
01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:19.280
Many times I've been told

1437
01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:20.725
Ah!

1438
01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:23.681
Ah!

1439
01:59:23.800 --> 01:59:26.371
Speak your mind, just be bold

1440
01:59:27.320 --> 01:59:30.529
So I close my eyes

1441
01:59:30.840 --> 01:59:33.000
Look behind

1442
01:59:33.080 --> 01:59:35.128
Moving on

1443
01:59:35.880 --> 01:59:37.360
Moving on

1444
01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:41.926
So I close my eyes

1445
01:59:42.840 --> 01:59:45.764
And the tears will clear

1446
01:59:48.280 --> 01:59:51.284
Then I feel no fear

1447
01:59:52.760 --> 01:59:55.360
Then I'd feel no way

1448
01:59:55.440 --> 01:59:57.966
My paths will remain straight

1449
02:00:02.440 --> 02:00:04.280
Beautiful. Beautiful.

1450
02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:20.005
I'm just trying to hold on to a dream

1451
02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:29.326
Out here lost and nothing's what it seems

1452
02:00:31.400 --> 02:00:37.487
I'm just trying to find where I belong

1453
02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:45.011
This must be the dark before the dawn

1454
02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:51.809
When the place that you were born

1455
02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:55.846
Is not where you belong

1456
02:00:57.280 --> 02:01:03.162
Tell me, baby, what stops
you from wearing a crown?

1457
02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:09.370
I wanna be somebody, be somebody

1458
02:01:12.120 --> 02:01:16.887
And I wanna go somewhere, go somewhere

1459
02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:26.530
Back to life, life,
life, life, life, life, baby

1460
02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:33.285
Back to life, life

1461
02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:37.564
I've been waiting for all of my life

1462
02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:40.730
Back to life

1463
02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:43.481
Mmm

1464
02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:48.044
Mmm

1465
02:01:52.720 --> 02:01:53.960
Bring the flavor to the fish

1466
02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:55.883
Bring the flavor to the rice

1467
02:01:56.480 --> 02:01:57.891
Who's the number one spice?

1468
02:01:58.280 --> 02:01:59.440
Who's the number one spice?

1469
02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:01.561
Bring the flavor to the fish
Bring the flavor to the rice

1470
02:02:01.680 --> 02:02:03.011
Who's the number one spice?

1471
02:02:07.080 --> 02:02:09.208
Good price
The number one spice, sir

1472
02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:11.370
Who's the number one spice?

1473
02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:28.040
This is the number one spice

1474
02:02:28.120 --> 02:02:30.360
The number one spice
The number one spice

1475
02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:32.680
Bring the flavor to the fish
Bring the flavor to the rice

1476
02:02:32.760 --> 02:02:33.761
Who's the number one spice?

1477
02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:39.324
You think I'ma do this all my life?

1478
02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:43.720
Man, soon I'ma live
in the city with the lights

1479
02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:46.246
- With the lights?
- That's right

1480
02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:48.328
This spice to you is a means to me

1481
02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:50.560
Selling even if the price is misery

1482
02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:52.802
Same story in the salt lake vis a vis

1483
02:02:56.960 --> 02:02:59.320
Walking all day in the sun like a movie

1484
02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:09.764
I'll be happy when the people party

1485
02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:12.880
'Cause everybody's family, man
Even Bundi

1486
02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:14.166
Too many dreams

1487
02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:18.800
Wake up looking in the sky

1488
02:03:56.680 --> 02:03:58.842
Number one

1489
02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:00.291
Number one spice

1490
02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:02.251
- Number one
- Spice

1491
02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:04.444
- Number one
- Spice

1492
02:04:04.840 --> 02:04:06.171
Spice

1493
02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:08.203
It's the number one spice, sir
