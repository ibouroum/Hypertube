Echo Three to Echo Seven.

3
00:03:35.546 --> 00:03:37.634
Han, old buddy,
do you read me?

4
00:03:37.674 --> 00:03:39.804
<i>Loud and clear, kid.
What's up?</i>

5
00:03:39.843 --> 00:03:42.625
Well, I finished my circle.
I don't pick up any life readings.

6
00:03:42.636 --> 00:03:45.681
<i>There isn't enough life on this ice cube
to fill a space cruiser.</i>

7
00:03:45.716 --> 00:03:47.551
<i>The sensors are placed.
I'm going back.</i>

8
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.557
Right. I'll see you shortly.

9
00:03:49.602 --> 00:03:51.777
There's a meteorite
that hit the ground near here.

10
00:03:51.812 --> 00:03:54.117
I want to check it out.
It won't take long.

11
00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:55.235
Steady.

12
00:03:56.608 --> 00:04:00.001
Steady, girl. What's the matter?
You smell something?

13
00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:42.943
Chewie. Chewie?

14
00:04:48.787 --> 00:04:51.178
All right.
Don't lose your temper.

15
00:04:51.206 --> 00:04:53.729
I'll come right back
and give you a hand.

16
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.317
Solo.

17
00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:18.269
No sign of life out there, General.
The sensors are in place.

18
00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:21.176
- You'll know if anything comes around.
- Commander Skywalker reported in yet?

19
00:05:21.195 --> 00:05:24.108
No. He's checking out
a meteorite that hit near him.

20
00:05:24.114 --> 00:05:27.742
With all the meteor activity, it's gonna
be difficult to spot approaching ships.

21
00:05:27.743 --> 00:05:29.744
General, I gotta leave.
I can't stay any more.

22
00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:32.745
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- There's a price on my head.

23
00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:35.184
If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt,
I'm a dead man.

24
00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:37.123
A death mark's not
an easy thing to live with.

25
00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:41.244
You're a good fighter, Solo.
I hate to lose you.

26
00:05:41.258 --> 00:05:42.737
Thank you, General.

27
00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:52.853
Well, Your Highness,
guess this is it.

28
00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:54.816
That's right.

29
00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:00.128
Don't get all mushy on me.
So long, Princess.

30
00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:04.291
Han.

31
00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:09.244
- Yes, Your Highnessness.
- I thought you had decided to stay.

32
00:06:09.245 --> 00:06:12.202
The bounty hunter we ran into
in Ord Mantell changed my mind.

33
00:06:12.206 --> 00:06:14.555
Han, we need you.

34
00:06:14.585 --> 00:06:16.758
- We need?
- Yes.

35
00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:19.359
- What about you need?
- I need?

36
00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.945
I don't know what
you're talking about.

37
00:06:21.966 --> 00:06:25.594
- You probably don't.
- What precisely am I supposed to know?

38
00:06:25.595 --> 00:06:29.180
Come on. You want me to stay because
of the way you feel about me.

39
00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:31.877
Yes. You're a great help to us.
You're a natural leader.

40
00:06:31.893 --> 00:06:34.546
No. That's not it.

41
00:06:34.562 --> 00:06:36.258
Come on.

42
00:06:37.482 --> 00:06:39.570
- Come on.
- You're imagining things.

43
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.610
Am I?
Then why are you following me?

44
00:06:41.652 --> 00:06:43.957
Afraid I'd leave
without giving you a goodbye kiss?

45
00:06:43.988 --> 00:06:46.685
- I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
- I can arrange that.

46
00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:48.917
You could use a good kiss!

47
00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:52.696
Don't blame me. I didn't ask you
to turn on the thermal heater.

48
00:06:52.706 --> 00:06:56.250
I merely commented that it was freezing
in the princess's chamber.

49
00:06:56.251 --> 00:06:58.163
It's supposed to be freezing.

50
00:06:58.211 --> 00:07:00.734
How we're going to dry
her clothes I really don't know.

51
00:07:00.756 --> 00:07:02.016
Oh, switch off!

52
00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:05.301
Why did you take this apart now?
I'm trying to get us out of here.

53
00:07:05.302 --> 00:07:07.520
- Excuse me.
- Put them back together right now.

54
00:07:07.554 --> 00:07:09.686
- Might I have a word?
- What do you want?

55
00:07:09.723 --> 00:07:12.332
Princess Leia's been trying
to get you on the communicator.

56
00:07:12.351 --> 00:07:14.613
I turned it off.
I don't want to talk to her.

57
00:07:14.645 --> 00:07:17.646
Princess Leia is wondering about
Master Luke. He hasn't come back.

58
00:07:17.648 --> 00:07:19.996
- She doesn't know where he is.
- I don't know where he is.

59
00:07:20.026 --> 00:07:22.940
- Nobody knows where he is.
- What do you mean, nobody knows?

60
00:07:22.945 --> 00:07:24.294
Deck Officer.

61
00:07:24.363 --> 00:07:26.971
- Deck Officer.
- Excuse me, sir. Might I...

62
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:28.817
Do you know where
Commander Skywalker is?

63
00:07:28.867 --> 00:07:31.651
I haven't seen him. It's possible
he came in the south entrance.

64
00:07:31.663 --> 00:07:33.967
It's possible?
Why don't you go find out?

65
00:07:33.997 --> 00:07:36.651
- It's getting dark out there.
- Yes, sir.

66
00:07:36.668 --> 00:07:39.146
Excuse me, sir.
Might I enquire what's going on?

67
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.562
- Why not?
- Impossible man.

68
00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:43.676
Come along, R2.
Let's find Princess Leia.

69
00:07:43.716 --> 00:07:46.891
Between ourselves, I think
Master Luke is in considerable danger.

70
00:07:56.396 --> 00:07:58.657
Commander Skywalker
hasn't come in the south entrance.

71
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.250
- Maybe he forgot to check in.
- Not likely. Are the speeders ready?

72
00:08:01.276 --> 00:08:03.476
Not yet. We're having trouble
adapting them to the cold.

73
00:08:03.486 --> 00:08:06.574
- We'll have to go out on tauntauns.
- The temperature's dropping too rapidly.

74
00:08:06.609 --> 00:08:08.703
That's right,
and my friend's out in it.

75
00:08:13.413 --> 00:08:15.980
Your tauntaun will freeze
before you reach the first marker.

76
00:08:15.999 --> 00:08:18.130
Then I'll see you in hell.

77
00:10:35.893 --> 00:10:37.849
You must come along now, R2.

78
00:10:37.895 --> 00:10:40.025
There's really
nothing more we can do.

79
00:10:40.064 --> 00:10:42.238
And my joints are freezing up.

80
00:10:43.233 --> 00:10:47.277
Don't say things like that.
Of course we'll see Master Luke again.

81
00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:50.149
And he'll be quite all right.
You'll see.

82
00:10:50.158 --> 00:10:53.941
Stupid little short circuit.
He'll be quite all right.

83
00:11:51.387 --> 00:11:54.343
Sir, all the patrols are in.
Still no...

84
00:11:55.473 --> 00:11:58.431
Still no contact
from Skywalker or Solo.

85
00:11:58.435 --> 00:12:02.646
Mistress Leia, R2 says he's been
quite unable to pick up any signals...

86
00:12:02.647 --> 00:12:06.150
although he admits that his own range
is far too weak to abandon all hope.

87
00:12:06.151 --> 00:12:08.369
Your Highness,
there's nothing more we can do tonight.

88
00:12:08.403 --> 00:12:10.838
The shield doors must be closed.

89
00:12:12.074 --> 00:12:14.596
- Close the doors.
- Yes, sir.

90
00:12:15.996 --> 00:12:20.952
R2 says the chances
of survival are 725-to-1.

91
00:12:32.345 --> 00:12:36.215
Actually, R2 has been known
to make mistakes...

92
00:12:38.767 --> 00:12:40.855
from time to time.

93
00:12:40.896 --> 00:12:42.809
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

94
00:12:45.692 --> 00:12:48.432
Don't worry about Master Luke.
I'm sure he'll be all right.

95
00:12:48.444 --> 00:12:51.358
He's quite clever, you know,
for a human being.

96
00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.121
<i>Luke.</i>

97
00:13:10.884 --> 00:13:12.276
Luke.

98
00:13:19.727 --> 00:13:21.336
Ben?

99
00:13:21.394 --> 00:13:24.134
You will go to
the Dagobah system.

100
00:13:24.148 --> 00:13:25.975
Dagobah system?

101
00:13:26.025 --> 00:13:29.611
There you will
learn from Yoda...

102
00:13:29.612 --> 00:13:33.525
the Jedi master
who instructed me.

103
00:13:51.843 --> 00:13:55.366
Don't do this, Luke.
Give me a sign here.

104
00:14:18.954 --> 00:14:21.346
- Not much time.
- Ben.

105
00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:28.924
Hang on, kid.

106
00:14:31.049 --> 00:14:33.354
Dagobah system. Dagobah.

107
00:14:33.385 --> 00:14:35.125
This may smell bad, kid...

108
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.430
Yoda.

109
00:14:38.475 --> 00:14:43.060
But it'll keep you warm
till I get the shelter up.

110
00:14:43.061 --> 00:14:45.193
Ben. Dagobah.

111
00:14:49.027 --> 00:14:51.114
I thought they smelled bad...

112
00:14:51.154 --> 00:14:53.067
on the outside.

113
00:15:36.325 --> 00:15:38.846
Echo Base, I've got something.

114
00:15:38.868 --> 00:15:40.869
Not much,
but it could be a life form.

115
00:15:45.417 --> 00:15:47.766
Commander Skywalker,
do you copy?

116
00:15:47.795 --> 00:15:52.579
This is Rogue Two.

117
00:15:52.591 --> 00:15:55.548
Captain Solo, do you copy?

118
00:16:01.142 --> 00:16:04.727
Commander Skywalker,
do you copy?

119
00:16:04.728 --> 00:16:06.643
This is Rogue Two.

120
00:16:06.689 --> 00:16:09.907
<i>Good morning.
Nice of you guys to drop by.</i>

121
00:16:10.735 --> 00:16:13.903
Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.

122
00:16:13.905 --> 00:16:16.601
I've found them.
Repeat. I've found them.

123
00:16:47.146 --> 00:16:50.536
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

124
00:16:50.568 --> 00:16:53.395
- Thanks, 3PO.
- R2 expresses his relief also.

125
00:16:53.404 --> 00:16:57.032
How ya feelin', kid?
You don't look so bad to me.

126
00:16:57.033 --> 00:17:00.034
You look strong enough
to pull the ears off a gundark.

127
00:17:00.036 --> 00:17:03.954
- Thanks to you.
- That's two you owe me, junior.

128
00:17:03.956 --> 00:17:05.348
Well, Your Worship...

129
00:17:05.415 --> 00:17:08.627
looks like you managed to keep me around
for a little while longer.

130
00:17:08.628 --> 00:17:10.585
I had nothing to do with it.

131
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.369
General Rieekan thinks
it's dangerous for any ships to leave...

132
00:17:13.382 --> 00:17:15.382
until we've activated the energy field.

133
00:17:15.426 --> 00:17:16.730
That's a good story.

134
00:17:16.802 --> 00:17:20.847
I think you just can't bear to let a
gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.

135
00:17:20.848 --> 00:17:24.284
I don't know where
you get your delusions, laser brain.

136
00:17:27.606 --> 00:17:29.911
Laugh it up, fuzzball...

137
00:17:29.941 --> 00:17:33.151
but you didn't see us alone
in the south passage.

138
00:17:33.153 --> 00:17:35.501
She expressed
her true feelings for me.

139
00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:36.704
My...

140
00:17:36.781 --> 00:17:40.326
Why, you stuck-up, half-witted...

141
00:17:40.327 --> 00:17:42.458
scruffy-looking nerf herder!

142
00:17:43.663 --> 00:17:45.621
Who's scruffy-lookin'?

143
00:17:48.919 --> 00:17:52.441
I must have hit close to the mark
to get her riled up like that, huh, kid?

144
00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:59.010
I guess you don't know
everything about women yet.

145
00:18:05.144 --> 00:18:07.927
<i>Headquarters personnel,
report to command center.</i>

146
00:18:10.775 --> 00:18:13.819
<i>Headquarters personnel,
report to command center.</i>

147
00:18:13.854 --> 00:18:15.863
Take it easy.

148
00:18:15.904 --> 00:18:18.036
Excuse us, please.

149
00:18:20.243 --> 00:18:22.375
Princess, we have a visitor.

150
00:18:23.454 --> 00:18:26.454
We picked up something
outside Zone 12 moving east.

151
00:18:26.456 --> 00:18:28.805
- It's metal.
- It couldn't be one of those creatures.

152
00:18:28.834 --> 00:18:32.754
- Could be one of our speeders.
- No. Wait.

153
00:18:32.755 --> 00:18:35.495
There's something
very weak coming through.

154
00:18:38.721 --> 00:18:41.889
Sir, I am fluent in six million
forms of communication.

155
00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:45.151
This signal is not used by the Alliance.
It could be an imperial code.

156
00:18:51.024 --> 00:18:53.154
It isn't friendly.
Chewie, let's check it out.

157
00:18:53.194 --> 00:18:56.324
Send Rogues 10 and 11
to Station 38.

158
00:19:32.399 --> 00:19:34.531
<i>- I'm afraid there's not much left.
- What was it?</i>

159
00:19:34.568 --> 00:19:36.699
<i>Droid of some kind.
I didn't hit it that hard.</i>

160
00:19:36.737 --> 00:19:40.323
<i>- Must have had a self-destruct.
- An imperial probe droid.</i>

161
00:19:40.324 --> 00:19:43.325
<i>It's a good bet the Empire
knows we're here.</i>

162
00:19:43.327 --> 00:19:45.633
We'd better start the evacuation.

163
00:20:30.543 --> 00:20:33.151
- Admiral.
- Yes, Captain?

164
00:20:34.462 --> 00:20:37.463
I think we've got something, sir.
The report is only a fragment...

165
00:20:37.466 --> 00:20:40.467
from a probe droid in the Hoth system,
but it's the best lead we've had.

166
00:20:40.469 --> 00:20:43.680
We have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy.

167
00:20:43.681 --> 00:20:46.765
- I want proof, not leads.
- The visuals indicate life readings.

168
00:20:46.766 --> 00:20:49.116
It could mean anything.
If we followed up every lead...

169
00:20:49.145 --> 00:20:52.320
But, sir, the Hoth system is
supposed to be devoid of humans forms.

170
00:20:52.356 --> 00:20:54.792
- You found something?
- Yes, my lord.

171
00:20:57.153 --> 00:20:59.545
That's it.
The rebels are there.

172
00:21:00.405 --> 00:21:04.159
My lord, there are so many
uncharted settlements.

173
00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.031
- It could be smugglers...
- That is the system.

174
00:21:07.038 --> 00:21:09.517
And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.

175
00:21:09.541 --> 00:21:12.668
Set your course
for the Hoth system.

176
00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:15.191
General Veers,
prepare your men.

177
00:21:15.214 --> 00:21:16.514
Admiral.

178
00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:25.550
Groups Seven and 10
will stay behind to fly the speeders.

179
00:21:25.554 --> 00:21:27.254
As soon as each transport is loaded...

180
00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.660
evacuation control will give
clearance for immediate launch.

181
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:31.410
Right, sir.

182
00:21:33.524 --> 00:21:35.655
All right. That's it.

183
00:21:35.692 --> 00:21:37.171
Try it.

184
00:21:38.905 --> 00:21:41.731
Turn it off! Turn it off!

185
00:21:44.034 --> 00:21:47.537
Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-47s.

186
00:21:47.538 --> 00:21:51.291
Forget the heavy equipment. There's time
to get small modules on the transports.

187
00:21:51.292 --> 00:21:53.423
- Take care, sir.
- Thanks.

188
00:21:56.755 --> 00:22:00.016
Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?

189
00:22:03.638 --> 00:22:05.334
Okay, okay.

190
00:22:06.724 --> 00:22:08.247
Hi, kid.

191
00:22:08.309 --> 00:22:11.519
There's gotta be a reason for it.
Check it at the other end.

192
00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:12.999
Wait a second.

193
00:22:14.023 --> 00:22:16.545
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

194
00:22:22.658 --> 00:22:24.918
Be careful.

195
00:22:24.951 --> 00:22:26.864
You too.

196
00:22:32.917 --> 00:22:34.874
General, there's
a fleet of Stardestroyers...

197
00:22:34.919 --> 00:22:37.269
coming out of hyperspace
in Sector Four.

198
00:22:37.298 --> 00:22:40.382
Reroute all power
to the energy shield.

199
00:22:40.383 --> 00:22:43.594
We gotta hold them till
all transports are away.

200
00:22:43.595 --> 00:22:45.725
Prepare for ground assault.

201
00:22:59.528 --> 00:23:02.989
- What is it, General?
- The fleet has moved out of light speed.

202
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:05.164
ComScan has detected
an energy field...

203
00:23:05.202 --> 00:23:07.896
protecting an area of the sixth planet
of the Hoth system.

204
00:23:07.912 --> 00:23:10.477
The field is strong enough
to deflect any bombardment.

205
00:23:10.498 --> 00:23:13.063
The rebels are alerted
to our presence.

206
00:23:13.083 --> 00:23:16.295
Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed
too close to the system.

207
00:23:16.296 --> 00:23:18.644
He felt surprise was wiser.

208
00:23:18.673 --> 00:23:20.847
He is as clumsy as he is stupid.

209
00:23:20.883 --> 00:23:24.594
General, prepare your troops
for a surface attack.

210
00:23:24.595 --> 00:23:26.291
Yes, my lord.

211
00:23:33.104 --> 00:23:34.364
<i>Lord Vader.</i>

212
00:23:34.439 --> 00:23:37.570
<i>The fleet has moved out of light speed,
and we're preparing to...</i>

213
00:23:38.527 --> 00:23:42.780
You have failed me
for the last time, Admiral.

214
00:23:42.782 --> 00:23:45.260
<i>- Captain Piett.
- Yes, my lord?</i>

215
00:23:45.283 --> 00:23:48.409
Make ready to land our troops
beyond their energy field...

216
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:51.497
and deploy the fleet so that
nothing gets off the system.

217
00:23:51.498 --> 00:23:54.792
You are in command now,
Admiral Piett.

218
00:23:54.793 --> 00:23:56.706
<i>Thank you, Lord Vader.</i>

219
00:23:58.213 --> 00:24:01.424
All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.

220
00:24:01.425 --> 00:24:04.208
The heavy transport ships
will leave as soon as they're loaded.

221
00:24:04.219 --> 00:24:06.351
Only two fighter escorts per ship.

222
00:24:06.388 --> 00:24:09.599
The energy shield
can only be opened for a short time...

223
00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.210
so you'll have to stay very close
to your transports.

224
00:24:12.228 --> 00:24:14.402
Two fighters against a Stardestroyer?

225
00:24:14.438 --> 00:24:16.569
The ion cannon will fire
several shots...

226
00:24:16.606 --> 00:24:19.860
to make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path.

227
00:24:19.861 --> 00:24:22.035
When you've gotten past
the energy shield...

228
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:24.202
proceed directly
to the rendezvous point.

229
00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.241
Understood?

230
00:24:26.284 --> 00:24:27.937
Good luck.

231
00:24:27.994 --> 00:24:30.558
Everybody to your stations.
Let's go.

232
00:24:47.597 --> 00:24:50.807
Their primary target will be
the power generators.

233
00:24:50.808 --> 00:24:52.722
Prepare to open shield.

234
00:24:58.483 --> 00:25:00.744
Sir, rebel ships are
coming into our sector.

235
00:25:00.776 --> 00:25:02.951
Good. Our first catch of the day.

236
00:25:04.906 --> 00:25:07.037
Stand by, ion control.

237
00:25:08.035 --> 00:25:09.079
Fire.

238
00:25:24.302 --> 00:25:30.341
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

239
00:25:36.731 --> 00:25:38.688
Feeling all right, sir?

240
00:25:38.733 --> 00:25:40.690
Just like new, Dak.
How about you?

241
00:25:40.734 --> 00:25:43.779
Right now I feel I could take on
the whole Empire myself.

242
00:25:43.814 --> 00:25:45.911
I know what you mean.

243
00:26:04.175 --> 00:26:07.595
Echo Station 3-T8.
We've spotted imperial walkers.

244
00:26:07.596 --> 00:26:10.161
<i>Imperial walkers
on the north ridge.</i>

245
00:26:32.163 --> 00:26:34.554
Echo Station 57,
we're on our way.

246
00:26:39.879 --> 00:26:41.967
All right, boys,
keep tight now.

247
00:26:42.006 --> 00:26:44.224
Luke, I have no approach vector.
I'm not set.

248
00:26:44.258 --> 00:26:45.780
Steady, Dak.

249
00:26:45.844 --> 00:26:47.757
Attack pattern Delta.
Go now.

250
00:26:51.472 --> 00:26:53.169
I'm coming in.

251
00:26:57.647 --> 00:26:58.734
Hobbie, you still with me?

252
00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:23.638
That armor's too strong for blasters.

253
00:27:26.009 --> 00:27:28.271
Rogue Group,
use your harpoons and tow cables.

254
00:27:28.303 --> 00:27:30.565
Go for the legs.
It might be our only chance.

255
00:27:32.849 --> 00:27:34.153
Stand by, Dak.

256
00:27:34.226 --> 00:27:37.140
Luke, we've got
a malfunction in fire control.

257
00:27:37.145 --> 00:27:39.233
I'll have to cut in the auxiliary.

258
00:27:39.272 --> 00:27:41.229
Just hang on.

259
00:27:41.274 --> 00:27:44.189
Hang on, Dak.
Get ready to fire that tow cable.

260
00:27:49.491 --> 00:27:50.491
Dak?

261
00:28:14.601 --> 00:28:17.644
Yes, Lord Vader.
I've reached the main power generators.

262
00:28:17.645 --> 00:28:20.863
The shield will be down in moments.
You may start your landing.

263
00:28:25.737 --> 00:28:26.955
Rogue Three.

264
00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:28.509
Copy, Rogue Leader.

265
00:28:28.574 --> 00:28:31.658
<i>Wedge, I've lost my gunner.
You'll have to make this shot.</i>

266
00:28:31.659 --> 00:28:33.442
<i>I'll cover for you.</i>

267
00:28:33.494 --> 00:28:35.930
Set your harpoon.
Follow me on the next pass.

268
00:28:37.082 --> 00:28:39.083
Coming around, Rogue Leader.

269
00:28:41.879 --> 00:28:43.399
Steady, Rogue Two.

270
00:28:44.339 --> 00:28:45.426
Activate harpoon.

271
00:28:48.385 --> 00:28:49.951
Good shot, Janson.

272
00:28:55.934 --> 00:28:58.325
One more pass.

273
00:29:03.817 --> 00:29:06.166
Cable out.
Let her go!

274
00:29:06.196 --> 00:29:07.457
Detach cable.

275
00:29:08.156 --> 00:29:09.330
Cable detached.

276
00:29:17.165 --> 00:29:18.860
Come on!

277
00:29:26.633 --> 00:29:29.329
- That got him!
- I see it, Wedge. Good work.

278
00:29:29.761 --> 00:29:31.891
I don't think we can protect
two transports at a time.

279
00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:34.322
It's risky, but we can't
hold out much longer.

280
00:29:34.349 --> 00:29:36.045
We have no choice.

281
00:29:36.935 --> 00:29:39.717
- Launch patrol.
- Evacuate remaining ground staff.

282
00:29:44.485 --> 00:29:48.153
This one goes there,
that one goes there. Right?

283
00:29:48.154 --> 00:29:51.764
R2, you take good care
of Master Luke now, understand?

284
00:29:53.451 --> 00:29:55.669
And do take good care of yourself.

285
00:29:59.291 --> 00:30:00.857
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

286
00:30:24.608 --> 00:30:27.043
All troops will debark
for ground assault.

287
00:30:27.069 --> 00:30:29.636
Prepare to target
the main generator.

288
00:30:33.201 --> 00:30:36.786
- Rogue Two, are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm with you, Rogue Leader.

289
00:30:36.787 --> 00:30:38.700
Set harpoon.
I'll cover for you.

290
00:30:40.207 --> 00:30:43.252
- Coming around.
- Watch that crossfire, boys.

291
00:30:44.588 --> 00:30:46.457
Set for position three.

292
00:30:46.506 --> 00:30:47.855
Steady.

293
00:30:47.924 --> 00:30:50.533
Stay tight and low.
This is it!

294
00:30:56.308 --> 00:30:57.613
Hobbie!

295
00:30:57.684 --> 00:30:59.206
I've been hit!

296
00:31:41.896 --> 00:31:44.679
- You all right?
- Why are you still here?

297
00:31:44.691 --> 00:31:47.818
- Heard the command center had been hit.
- You've got your clearance to leave.

298
00:31:47.819 --> 00:31:51.363
Don't worry. I'll leave.
First I'm gonna get you to your ship.

299
00:31:51.364 --> 00:31:54.574
Your Highness, we must take
this last transport. It's our only hope.

300
00:31:54.575 --> 00:31:57.794
Send all troops in Sector 12 to
the south slope to protect the fighters.

301
00:31:59.331 --> 00:32:01.461
<i>Imperial troops
have entered the base.</i>

302
00:32:01.499 --> 00:32:03.194
<i>Imperial troops have entered...</i>

303
00:32:03.251 --> 00:32:05.207
Come on. That's it.

304
00:32:05.254 --> 00:32:07.689
Give the evacuation code signal.

305
00:32:09.508 --> 00:32:11.640
And get to your transports.

306
00:32:11.677 --> 00:32:12.851
Wait for me.

307
00:32:12.928 --> 00:32:14.450
Begin retreat!

308
00:32:15.472 --> 00:32:17.385
Fall back!

309
00:33:15.074 --> 00:33:18.467
- Distance to power generators?
- 17.28.

310
00:33:27.462 --> 00:33:29.462
Target. Maximum firepower.

311
00:33:55.741 --> 00:33:58.437
Transport, this is Solo.
Take off. I can't get to you.

312
00:33:58.452 --> 00:34:00.453
<i>I'll get her out on the Falcon.
Come on.</i>

313
00:34:02.998 --> 00:34:05.129
Where are you going?
Come back!

314
00:34:23.561 --> 00:34:27.064
Wait! Wait for me! Stop!

315
00:34:27.065 --> 00:34:28.978
- How typical.
- Come on.

316
00:34:32.822 --> 00:34:35.865
Hurry up, goldenrod!
You're gonna be a permanent resident.

317
00:34:35.866 --> 00:34:37.691
Wait! Wait!

318
00:34:55.553 --> 00:34:58.847
- How's this?
- Would it help if I got out and pushed?

319
00:34:58.848 --> 00:35:01.152
- Captain Solo. Captain Solo.
- It might.

320
00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:05.135
Sir, might I suggest that you...

321
00:35:05.145 --> 00:35:06.884
It can wait.

322
00:35:11.068 --> 00:35:13.678
This bucket of bolts
will never get past that blockade.

323
00:35:13.697 --> 00:35:15.828
This baby's got
a few surprises left in her.

324
00:35:24.917 --> 00:35:26.786
Come on! Come on!

325
00:35:26.834 --> 00:35:29.734
Switch over.
Let's hope we don't have a burnout.

326
00:35:31.881 --> 00:35:32.631
See?

327
00:35:32.632 --> 00:35:35.132
Someday you're gonna be wrong.
I just hope I'm there to see it.

328
00:35:37.804 --> 00:35:38.979
Punch it!

329
00:35:57.032 --> 00:35:58.076
R2.

330
00:35:59.701 --> 00:36:01.832
Get her ready for take-off.

331
00:36:04.039 --> 00:36:06.300
Good luck, Luke.
See you at the rendezvous.

332
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:12.235
Don't worry, R2.
We're going. We're going.

333
00:36:24.269 --> 00:36:28.008
There's nothing wrong, R2.
I'm just setting a new course.

334
00:36:31.317 --> 00:36:35.666
We're not gonna regroup with the others.
We're going to the Dagobah system.

335
00:36:37.866 --> 00:36:39.388
Yes, R2.

336
00:36:42.245 --> 00:36:45.332
That's all right. I'd like to keep it
on manual control for a while.

337
00:37:01.931 --> 00:37:04.411
- I saw 'em! I saw 'em!
- Saw what?

338
00:37:04.435 --> 00:37:06.696
Stardestroyers,
two of'em coming right at us.

339
00:37:06.729 --> 00:37:09.641
- Sir, might I suggest...
- Shut him up or shut him down!

340
00:37:11.316 --> 00:37:13.446
Check the deflector shield.

341
00:37:15.403 --> 00:37:17.535
Great. Well, we can still
outmaneuver them.

342
00:37:21.785 --> 00:37:23.829
Take evasive action!

343
00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:38.212
- Prepare to jump to light speed.
- But, sir!

344
00:37:39.094 --> 00:37:40.877
They're getting closer.

345
00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:43.148
Oh, yeah?
Watch this.

346
00:37:46.185 --> 00:37:47.881
Watch what?

347
00:37:49.397 --> 00:37:51.962
- I think we're in trouble.
- If I may say so...

348
00:37:51.982 --> 00:37:54.548
I noticed earlier the hyperdrive
motivator has been damaged.

349
00:37:54.568 --> 00:37:57.787
- It's impossible to go to light speed.
- We're in trouble.

350
00:38:01.952 --> 00:38:03.256
Horizontal boosters!

351
00:38:05.413 --> 00:38:07.500
Alluvial dampers.

352
00:38:10.252 --> 00:38:13.035
That's not it.
Bring me the hydrospanner.

353
00:38:16.424 --> 00:38:19.207
I don't know how
we're gonna get out of this one.

354
00:38:21.805 --> 00:38:23.065
Chewie!

355
00:38:26.686 --> 00:38:28.816
That wasn't a laser blast.
Something hit us.

356
00:38:28.855 --> 00:38:30.333
Han, get up here.

357
00:38:32.024 --> 00:38:33.501
Come on, Chewie!

358
00:38:34.276 --> 00:38:35.320
Asteroids.

359
00:38:39.239 --> 00:38:41.936
- Chewie, set 271.
- What are you doing?

360
00:38:43.327 --> 00:38:45.633
You're not actually going
into an asteroid field?

361
00:38:45.663 --> 00:38:47.489
They'd be crazy to follow us,
wouldn't they?

362
00:38:50.625 --> 00:38:52.626
You don't have to do this
to impress me.

363
00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:55.964
Sir, the possibility of successfully
navigating an asteroid field...

364
00:38:55.965 --> 00:38:59.357
- is approximately 3,720-to-1.
- Never tell me the odds.

365
00:39:27.206 --> 00:39:30.457
You said you wanted to be around when
I made a mistake. This could be it.

366
00:39:30.458 --> 00:39:32.154
I take it back.

367
00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:35.421
We're gonna get pulverized
if we stay out here much longer.

368
00:39:35.422 --> 00:39:37.292
- Ain't gonna argue with that.
- Pulverized?

369
00:39:37.341 --> 00:39:39.255
I'm going closer
to one of the big ones.

370
00:39:39.301 --> 00:39:41.214
- Closer?
- Closer?

371
00:40:08.248 --> 00:40:10.204
This is suicide!
There's nowhere to go.

372
00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:12.292
There. That looks pretty good.

373
00:40:12.334 --> 00:40:14.291
What looks pretty good?

374
00:40:14.336 --> 00:40:16.815
Yeah. That'll do nicely.

375
00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.797
Excuse me, ma'am,
but where are we going?

376
00:40:29.644 --> 00:40:31.949
I hope you know
what you're doing.

377
00:40:31.981 --> 00:40:33.459
Yeah. Me too.

378
00:40:42.199 --> 00:40:44.547
Yep, that's it. Dagobah.

379
00:40:46.912 --> 00:40:49.217
No, I'm not gonna change
my mind about this.

380
00:40:50.082 --> 00:40:52.648
I'm not picking up
any cities or technology.

381
00:40:52.668 --> 00:40:54.798
Massive life form readings though.

382
00:40:55.795 --> 00:40:57.926
There's something alive down there.

383
00:40:59.508 --> 00:41:02.509
Yes. I'm sure
it's perfectly safe for droids.

384
00:41:10.101 --> 00:41:11.885
I know! I know!

385
00:41:11.937 --> 00:41:14.721
All the scopes are dead.
I can't see a thing.

386
00:41:14.732 --> 00:41:17.906
Just hang on.
I'm gonna start the landing cycle.

387
00:42:11.916 --> 00:42:14.656
No, R2, you stay put.
I'll have a look around.

388
00:42:19.047 --> 00:42:20.309
R2?

389
00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:25.394
Where are you?

390
00:42:29.016 --> 00:42:30.364
R2!

391
00:42:37.191 --> 00:42:38.800
You be more careful.

392
00:42:41.779 --> 00:42:44.694
R2, that way.

393
00:43:12.644 --> 00:43:14.036
R2!

394
00:43:41.632 --> 00:43:43.197
Oh, no.

395
00:43:44.385 --> 00:43:46.516
Are you all right?
Come on.

396
00:43:49.974 --> 00:43:52.105
You were lucky
to get out of there.

397
00:43:53.269 --> 00:43:55.140
Anything broken?

398
00:43:57.814 --> 00:44:01.026
If you're saying
coming here was a bad idea...

399
00:44:01.027 --> 00:44:03.289
I'm beginning to agree with ya.

400
00:44:03.321 --> 00:44:06.104
R2, what are we doing here?

401
00:44:06.116 --> 00:44:07.595
It's like...

402
00:44:08.618 --> 00:44:10.749
something out of a dream or...

403
00:44:11.621 --> 00:44:13.753
I don't know.

404
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:15.922
Maybe I'm just going crazy.

405
00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:49.636
Yes, Admiral?

406
00:44:49.703 --> 00:44:51.876
<i>Our ships have sighted
the Millennium Falcon, lord...</i>

407
00:44:51.911 --> 00:44:55.123
but it has entered an asteroid field,
and we cannot risk...

408
00:44:55.124 --> 00:44:58.037
Asteroids do not
concern me, Admiral.

409
00:44:58.044 --> 00:45:01.741
- I want that ship, not excuses.
- Yes, lord.

410
00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:10.931
I'm gonna shut down everything
but the emergency power systems.

411
00:45:10.932 --> 00:45:15.019
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does
that include shutting me down too?

412
00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:17.150
<i>No. I need you
to talk to the Falcon...</i>

413
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:19.538
find out what's wrong
with the hyperdrive.

414
00:45:27.282 --> 00:45:30.910
Sir, it's quite possible
this asteroid is not entirely stable.

415
00:45:30.911 --> 00:45:32.867
Not entirely stable?

416
00:45:32.913 --> 00:45:35.043
I'm glad you're here
to tell us these things.

417
00:45:35.081 --> 00:45:38.792
Chewie, take the professor in the back
and plug him into the hyperdrive.

418
00:45:38.793 --> 00:45:41.403
Sometimes I just don't
understand human behaviour.

419
00:45:41.421 --> 00:45:43.857
After all, I'm only
trying to do my job.

420
00:45:48.845 --> 00:45:50.324
Let go.

421
00:45:52.099 --> 00:45:54.491
- Let go, please.
- Don't get excited.

422
00:45:54.519 --> 00:45:58.355
Captain, being held by you
isn't quite enough to get me excited.

423
00:45:58.356 --> 00:46:00.270
Sorry, sweetheart.

424
00:46:00.317 --> 00:46:03.099
I haven't got time
for anything else.

425
00:46:37.437 --> 00:46:41.004
Ready for some power?
Okay.

426
00:46:44.861 --> 00:46:46.340
Let's see now.

427
00:46:46.404 --> 00:46:48.796
Put that in there.
There you go.

428
00:46:51.828 --> 00:46:54.698
Now all I gotta do
is find this Yoda...

429
00:46:54.705 --> 00:46:57.098
if he even exists.

430
00:47:02.504 --> 00:47:05.549
It's really a strange place
to find a Jedi master.

431
00:47:06.885 --> 00:47:08.798
This place gives me the creeps.

432
00:47:12.639 --> 00:47:14.117
Still...

433
00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:17.437
there's something familiar
about this place.

434
00:47:19.605 --> 00:47:21.475
I don't know.

435
00:47:21.524 --> 00:47:23.655
- I feel like...
- Feel like what?

436
00:47:24.652 --> 00:47:26.348
Like we're being watched.

437
00:47:26.403 --> 00:47:29.534
Away put your weapon.
I mean you no harm.

438
00:47:30.657 --> 00:47:33.442
I am wondering,
why are you here?

439
00:47:35.038 --> 00:47:38.165
- I'm looking for someone.
- Looking?

440
00:47:38.166 --> 00:47:40.905
Found someone you have,
I would say.

441
00:47:42.003 --> 00:47:43.612
Right.

442
00:47:44.506 --> 00:47:46.985
Help you I can. Yes.

443
00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.020
I don't think so.

444
00:47:50.596 --> 00:47:53.423
I'm looking for a great warrior.

445
00:47:53.432 --> 00:47:55.128
Great warrior.

446
00:47:58.144 --> 00:48:00.493
Wars not make one great.

447
00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:10.564
Put that down.

448
00:48:10.616 --> 00:48:12.617
Hey! That's my dinner.

449
00:48:15.871 --> 00:48:18.698
How you get so big
eating food of this kind?

450
00:48:18.707 --> 00:48:21.013
Listen, friend, we didn't mean
to land in that puddle.

451
00:48:21.043 --> 00:48:23.695
If we could get our ship out, we would.
But we can't.

452
00:48:23.712 --> 00:48:25.887
Aw, cannot get your ship out.

453
00:48:25.923 --> 00:48:27.663
Get out of there.

454
00:48:30.845 --> 00:48:33.236
Hey, you could have broken this.

455
00:48:34.766 --> 00:48:36.896
Don't do that.

456
00:48:45.901 --> 00:48:48.033
You're making a mess.

457
00:48:49.447 --> 00:48:51.577
Hey, give me that.

458
00:48:51.616 --> 00:48:54.268
Mine, or I will help you not.

459
00:48:54.286 --> 00:48:56.374
I don't want your help.
I want my lamp back.

460
00:48:56.413 --> 00:48:59.284
I'm gonna need it to get out of
this slimy mud-hole.

461
00:48:59.291 --> 00:49:01.509
Mud-hole? Slimy?
My home this is.

462
00:49:05.296 --> 00:49:06.775
R2, let him have it.

463
00:49:09.426 --> 00:49:12.253
- Mine! Mine! Mine!
- R2.

464
00:49:16.058 --> 00:49:19.580
Will you move along, little fella?
We got a lot of work to do.

465
00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:23.869
Stay and help you I will.
Find your friend.

466
00:49:24.608 --> 00:49:27.608
I'm not looking for a friend.
I'm looking for a Jedi master.

467
00:49:29.613 --> 00:49:32.092
Jedi master. Yoda.

468
00:49:32.116 --> 00:49:34.812
- You seek Yoda.
- You know him?

469
00:49:36.495 --> 00:49:38.626
Take you to him I will.

470
00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:43.043
Yes, yes, but now we must eat.

471
00:49:43.044 --> 00:49:45.827
Come.
Good food. Come.

472
00:49:55.515 --> 00:49:57.211
Come, come.

473
00:49:59.353 --> 00:50:00.483
R2...

474
00:50:01.312 --> 00:50:03.660
stay and watch after the camp.

475
00:50:17.119 --> 00:50:19.250
Where is R2 when I need him?

476
00:50:19.289 --> 00:50:22.073
Sir, I don't know where your ship
learned to communicate...

477
00:50:22.084 --> 00:50:24.084
but it has the most peculiar dialect.

478
00:50:24.127 --> 00:50:27.755
I believe it says the power coupling
on the negative axis has been polarized.

479
00:50:27.756 --> 00:50:30.321
I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.

480
00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:33.650
Well, of course
I'll have to replace it.

481
00:50:34.805 --> 00:50:37.110
Here. And, Chewie...

482
00:50:38.684 --> 00:50:41.467
I think we better replace
the negative power coupling.

483
00:51:03.751 --> 00:51:06.535
Hey, Your Worship,
I'm only trying to help.

484
00:51:06.546 --> 00:51:09.113
Would you please
stop calling me that?

485
00:51:09.132 --> 00:51:11.175
Sure, Leia.

486
00:51:11.217 --> 00:51:14.783
- You make it so difficult sometimes.
- I do. I really do.

487
00:51:15.722 --> 00:51:18.070
You could be a little nicer though.

488
00:51:18.099 --> 00:51:20.882
Admit it.
Sometimes you think I'm all right.

489
00:51:23.147 --> 00:51:25.494
Occasionally, maybe...

490
00:51:25.522 --> 00:51:28.089
when you aren't acting
like a scoundrel.

491
00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:29.588
Scoundrel?

492
00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:35.274
I like the sound of that.

493
00:51:36.285 --> 00:51:39.197
- Stop that.
- Stop what?

494
00:51:39.204 --> 00:51:41.465
Stop that.
My hands are dirty.

495
00:51:41.497 --> 00:51:43.759
My hands are dirty too.
What are you afraid of?

496
00:51:43.791 --> 00:51:46.010
- Afraid?
- You're trembling.

497
00:51:46.879 --> 00:51:49.053
I'm not trembling.

498
00:51:50.424 --> 00:51:52.990
You like me because I'm a scoundrel.

499
00:51:53.009 --> 00:51:55.532
There aren't enough
scoundrels in your life.

500
00:51:55.554 --> 00:51:57.685
I happen to like nice men.

501
00:51:57.723 --> 00:52:00.506
- I'm a nice man.
- No, you're not.

502
00:52:03.313 --> 00:52:04.357
Sir, sir!

503
00:52:04.439 --> 00:52:07.439
I've isolated
the reverse power flux coupling.

504
00:52:09.568 --> 00:52:10.830
Thank you.

505
00:52:10.903 --> 00:52:13.991
- Thank you very much.
- You're perfectly welcome, sir.

506
00:52:19.955 --> 00:52:23.206
<i>That, Lord Vader, was the last time
they appeared in any of our scopes.</i>

507
00:52:23.207 --> 00:52:26.251
<i>Considering the damage we've sustained,
they must have been destroyed.</i>

508
00:52:26.252 --> 00:52:29.671
No, Captain, they're alive.

509
00:52:29.672 --> 00:52:34.195
I want every ship available to sweep
the asteroid field until they are found.

510
00:52:38.557 --> 00:52:41.976
- Lord Vader.
- Yes, Admiral. What is it?

511
00:52:41.977 --> 00:52:44.325
The emperor commands you
to make contact with him.

512
00:52:44.354 --> 00:52:46.616
Move the ship out of
the asteroid field...

513
00:52:46.648 --> 00:52:48.997
so that we can send
a clear transmission.

514
00:52:49.025 --> 00:52:50.721
Yes, my lord.

515
00:53:07.252 --> 00:53:09.905
What is thy bidding, my master?

516
00:53:11.089 --> 00:53:15.308
<i>There is a great disturbance
in the Force.</i>

517
00:53:16.012 --> 00:53:18.446
I have felt it.

518
00:53:18.471 --> 00:53:21.125
<i>We have a new enemy...</i>

519
00:53:21.142 --> 00:53:25.270
<i>the young rebel who destroyed
the Death Star.</i>

520
00:53:25.271 --> 00:53:28.523
<i>I have no doubt this boy...</i>

521
00:53:28.524 --> 00:53:33.028
<i>is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.</i>

522
00:53:33.029 --> 00:53:35.377
How is that possible?

523
00:53:35.406 --> 00:53:38.909
<i>Search your feelings, Lord Vader.</i>

524
00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:42.246
<i>You will know it to be true.</i>

525
00:53:42.247 --> 00:53:44.813
<i>He could destroy us.</i>

526
00:53:44.833 --> 00:53:47.007
He's just a boy.

527
00:53:47.044 --> 00:53:49.610
Obi-Wan can no longer help him.

528
00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:53.370
<i>The Force is strong with him.</i>

529
00:53:54.593 --> 00:53:59.638
<i>The son of Skywalker
must not become a Jedi.</i>

530
00:53:59.639 --> 00:54:01.900
If he could be turned...

531
00:54:01.934 --> 00:54:04.891
he would become a powerful ally.

532
00:54:05.812 --> 00:54:07.596
<i>Yes.</i>

533
00:54:08.398 --> 00:54:12.778
<i>He would be a great asset.</i>

534
00:54:12.779 --> 00:54:15.126
<i>Can it be done?</i>

535
00:54:15.155 --> 00:54:19.286
He will join us or die, master.

536
00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:39.806
I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't
understand why we can't see Yoda now.

537
00:54:39.807 --> 00:54:43.763
Patience. For the Jedi,
it is time to eat as well.

538
00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:49.065
Eat. Eat.

539
00:54:49.858 --> 00:54:51.249
Hot.

540
00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:00.993
Good food. Good.

541
00:55:01.035 --> 00:55:04.080
How far away is Yoda?
Will it take us long to get there?

542
00:55:04.081 --> 00:55:06.429
Not far. Yoda not far.

543
00:55:06.457 --> 00:55:09.328
Patience.
Soon you will be with him.

544
00:55:11.629 --> 00:55:14.414
Root leaf. I cook.

545
00:55:16.135 --> 00:55:18.701
Why wish you become Jedi?

546
00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:22.464
Mostly 'cause of my father, I guess.

547
00:55:22.474 --> 00:55:25.692
Father.
Powerful Jedi was he.

548
00:55:27.062 --> 00:55:28.889
- Powerful Jedi.
- Oh, come on.

549
00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:32.560
How could you know my father?
You don't even know who I am.

550
00:55:32.568 --> 00:55:36.221
I don't even know what I'm doing here.
We're wasting our time!

551
00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:39.881
I cannot teach him.

552
00:55:39.909 --> 00:55:42.039
The boy has no patience.

553
00:55:42.077 --> 00:55:44.426
<i>He will learn patience.</i>

554
00:55:49.168 --> 00:55:51.646
Much anger in him...

555
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:53.584
like his father.

556
00:55:53.631 --> 00:55:57.502
<i>Was I any different
when you taught me?</i>

557
00:55:58.720 --> 00:55:59.720
No.

558
00:56:00.639 --> 00:56:03.987
- He is not ready.
- Yoda.

559
00:56:06.978 --> 00:56:08.891
I am ready.

560
00:56:08.939 --> 00:56:12.442
I can be a Jedi.
Ben, tell him I'm...

561
00:56:12.477 --> 00:56:15.945
Ready, are you?
What know you ready?

562
00:56:15.946 --> 00:56:20.032
For 800 years have I trained Jedi.

563
00:56:20.033 --> 00:56:23.947
My own counsel will I keep
on who is to be trained.

564
00:56:25.747 --> 00:56:29.668
A Jedi must have
the deepest commitment...

565
00:56:29.669 --> 00:56:31.582
the most serious mind.

566
00:56:33.506 --> 00:56:36.723
This one a long time have I watched.

567
00:56:37.676 --> 00:56:40.546
All his life
has he looked away...

568
00:56:40.554 --> 00:56:43.723
to the future,
to the horizon.

569
00:56:43.724 --> 00:56:47.422
Never his mind on where he was...

570
00:56:48.603 --> 00:56:50.734
what he was doing.

571
00:56:52.358 --> 00:56:53.402
Adventure.

572
00:56:54.734 --> 00:56:56.431
Excitement.

573
00:56:56.487 --> 00:56:58.836
A Jedi craves not these things.

574
00:56:59.699 --> 00:57:01.569
You are reckless.

575
00:57:01.618 --> 00:57:04.703
<i>So was I, if you remember.</i>

576
00:57:04.704 --> 00:57:06.835
He is too old.

577
00:57:08.749 --> 00:57:11.011
Yes, too old to begin the training.

578
00:57:11.043 --> 00:57:13.044
But I've learned so much.

579
00:57:20.803 --> 00:57:24.195
- Will he finish what he begins?
- I won't fail you.

580
00:57:25.601 --> 00:57:27.340
I'm not afraid.

581
00:57:31.772 --> 00:57:33.903
You will be.

582
00:57:34.985 --> 00:57:37.116
You will be.

583
00:58:19.113 --> 00:58:22.742
- Sir, if I may venture an opinion...
- I'm not interested in your opinion.

584
00:58:22.743 --> 00:58:24.830
There's something out there.

585
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:26.913
- Where?
- Outside in the cave.

586
00:58:28.539 --> 00:58:30.104
There it is. Listen!

587
00:58:30.166 --> 00:58:32.123
- I'm going out there.
- Are you crazy?

588
00:58:32.168 --> 00:58:34.821
I just got this bucket together.
I won't let it get torn apart.

589
00:58:34.837 --> 00:58:37.056
Then I'm going with you.

590
00:58:38.217 --> 00:58:41.426
I think it might be better
if I stay behind and guard the ship.

591
00:58:41.427 --> 00:58:42.470
Oh, no.

592
00:58:57.528 --> 00:58:59.659
This ground sure feels strange.

593
00:59:01.198 --> 00:59:03.330
It doesn't feel like rock.

594
00:59:07.747 --> 00:59:10.442
There's an awful lot
of moisture in here.

595
00:59:10.457 --> 00:59:14.294
I don't know.
I have a bad feeling about this.

596
00:59:14.295 --> 00:59:15.556
Yeah.

597
00:59:17.590 --> 00:59:18.546
Watch out!

598
00:59:19.634 --> 00:59:22.199
It's all right. It's all right.

599
00:59:22.219 --> 00:59:24.785
Yeah, that's what I thought... mynock.

600
00:59:24.805 --> 00:59:28.057
Chewie, check the rest of the ship and
make sure there are no more attached...

601
00:59:28.058 --> 00:59:30.016
chewing on the power cables.

602
00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:31.713
Mynocks?

603
00:59:31.771 --> 00:59:34.076
Go inside. We'll clean them off
if there are any more.

604
00:59:43.157 --> 00:59:45.724
Go away!
Go away, beastly thing! Shoo!

605
00:59:52.918 --> 00:59:54.831
Wait a minute.

606
01:00:16.484 --> 01:00:20.027
- Chewie, let's get out of here!
- The Empire is still out there!

607
01:00:20.028 --> 01:00:22.159
No time to discuss this
in committee!

608
01:00:22.823 --> 01:00:24.954
I am not a committee!

609
01:00:30.331 --> 01:00:33.288
You can't make the jump to light speed
in this asteroid field.

610
01:00:33.292 --> 01:00:35.858
Sit down, sweetheart.
We're taking off.

611
01:00:40.550 --> 01:00:41.941
- Look!
- I see it.

612
01:00:42.009 --> 01:00:44.489
- We're doomed!
- The cave is collapsing.

613
01:00:44.513 --> 01:00:46.469
- This is no cave.
- What?

614
01:01:18.881 --> 01:01:20.316
Yes, run.

615
01:01:20.381 --> 01:01:21.990
Yes.

616
01:01:22.050 --> 01:01:25.512
A Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.

617
01:01:25.513 --> 01:01:29.056
But beware of the dark side.
Anger, fear, aggression...

618
01:01:29.057 --> 01:01:31.319
The dark side
of the Force are they.

619
01:01:31.351 --> 01:01:35.062
Easily they flow,
quick to join you in a fight.

620
01:01:35.063 --> 01:01:37.369
If once you start down
the dark path...

621
01:01:37.399 --> 01:01:39.791
forever will it dominate
your destiny.

622
01:01:39.818 --> 01:01:43.905
Consume you it will,
as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.

623
01:01:43.906 --> 01:01:45.819
Vader.

624
01:01:45.866 --> 01:01:49.084
- Is the dark side stronger?
- No, no.

625
01:01:50.705 --> 01:01:52.748
Quicker, easier, more seductive.

626
01:01:53.541 --> 01:01:55.716
How am I to know
the good side from the bad?

627
01:01:55.753 --> 01:01:58.100
You will know...

628
01:01:58.129 --> 01:02:00.477
when you are calm,
at peace...

629
01:02:01.466 --> 01:02:02.944
passive.

630
01:02:03.968 --> 01:02:08.263
A Jedi uses the Force
for knowledge and defense...

631
01:02:08.265 --> 01:02:10.178
never for attack.

632
01:02:10.226 --> 01:02:13.977
- But tell me why I can't...
- No. There is no why.

633
01:02:13.978 --> 01:02:16.848
Nothing more
will I teach you today.

634
01:02:16.856 --> 01:02:18.900
Clear your mind of questions.

635
01:02:41.923 --> 01:02:43.967
There's something not right here.

636
01:02:47.763 --> 01:02:49.241
I feel cold.

637
01:02:50.057 --> 01:02:51.666
- Death.
- That place...

638
01:02:52.726 --> 01:02:56.354
is strong with
the dark side of the Force.

639
01:02:56.355 --> 01:02:58.356
A domain of evil it is.

640
01:02:59.734 --> 01:03:01.735
In you must go.

641
01:03:02.863 --> 01:03:04.124
What's in there?

642
01:03:06.824 --> 01:03:09.216
Only what you take with you.

643
01:03:12.914 --> 01:03:14.176
Your weapons...

644
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.521
you will not need them.

645
01:05:56.706 --> 01:05:59.272
Bounty hunters.
We don't need their scum.

646
01:05:59.292 --> 01:06:02.163
- Yes, sir.
- Those rebels won't escape us.

647
01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:11.179
<i>Sir, we have a priority signal
from the Stardestroyer Avenger.</i>

648
01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:12.789
Right.

649
01:06:12.848 --> 01:06:18.770
<i>There will be a substantial reward for
the one who finds the Millennium Falcon.</i>

650
01:06:18.771 --> 01:06:21.941
You are free to use
any methods necessary...

651
01:06:21.942 --> 01:06:24.159
but I want them alive.

652
01:06:24.193 --> 01:06:26.715
No disintegrations.

653
01:06:26.736 --> 01:06:28.650
- As you wish.
- Lord Vader.

654
01:06:30.867 --> 01:06:32.868
My lord, we have them.

655
01:06:37.249 --> 01:06:40.466
Thank goodness
we're coming out of the asteroid field.

656
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:48.286
Let's get out of here.
Ready for light speed?

657
01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:50.606
One, two...

658
01:06:50.637 --> 01:06:51.810
three!

659
01:06:58.395 --> 01:07:00.744
It's not fair.

660
01:07:02.233 --> 01:07:05.146
Transfer circuits aren't working.
It's not my fault.

661
01:07:05.151 --> 01:07:08.195
- No light speed?
- It's not my fault.

662
01:07:12.869 --> 01:07:14.956
Sir, we just lost
the main rear deflector shield.

663
01:07:14.996 --> 01:07:17.344
One more direct hit
on the back quarter and we're done for.

664
01:07:17.372 --> 01:07:19.155
Turn her around.

665
01:07:19.208 --> 01:07:21.947
Turn her around! I'm gonna
put all power in the front shield.

666
01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:24.048
- You're gonna attack?
- The odds of surviving...

667
01:07:24.088 --> 01:07:26.089
a direct assault
on an imperial Stardestroyer...

668
01:07:26.131 --> 01:07:28.131
Shut up!

669
01:07:34.556 --> 01:07:36.600
They're moving to attack position.

670
01:07:38.728 --> 01:07:39.858
Shields up.

671
01:07:46.402 --> 01:07:49.098
Track them. They may
come around for another pass.

672
01:07:49.113 --> 01:07:51.591
Captain Needa, the ship no longer
appears on our scopes.

673
01:07:51.616 --> 01:07:55.368
They can't have disappeared. No ship
that small has a cloaking device.

674
01:07:55.369 --> 01:07:59.371
- There's no trace of them.
- Captain, Lord Vader demands an update.

675
01:08:02.210 --> 01:08:04.340
Get a shuttle ready.

676
01:08:04.378 --> 01:08:08.423
I shall assume full responsibility for
losing them and apologize to Lord Vader.

677
01:08:08.424 --> 01:08:11.642
- Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.
- Yes, Captain Needa.

678
01:08:16.224 --> 01:08:18.572
Use the Force.

679
01:08:18.602 --> 01:08:19.645
Yes.

680
01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:27.060
Now, the stone.

681
01:08:31.155 --> 01:08:32.852
Feel it.

682
01:08:44.502 --> 01:08:46.372
Concentrate!

683
01:09:00.978 --> 01:09:04.147
Oh, no.
We'll never get it out now.

684
01:09:04.148 --> 01:09:05.932
So certain are you.

685
01:09:09.947 --> 01:09:13.294
Always with you
it cannot be done.

686
01:09:14.409 --> 01:09:16.452
Hear you nothing that I say?

687
01:09:16.494 --> 01:09:18.669
Master, moving stones
around is one thing.

688
01:09:18.705 --> 01:09:20.618
This is totally different.

689
01:09:20.665 --> 01:09:23.013
No. No different.

690
01:09:23.042 --> 01:09:25.218
Only different in your mind.

691
01:09:25.254 --> 01:09:28.601
You must unlearn
what you have learned.

692
01:09:29.841 --> 01:09:33.059
- All right. I'll give it a try.
- Try not.

693
01:09:33.804 --> 01:09:35.282
Do...

694
01:09:35.347 --> 01:09:37.000
or do not.

695
01:09:37.057 --> 01:09:38.797
There is no try.

696
01:10:27.358 --> 01:10:30.402
I can't. It's too big.

697
01:10:30.403 --> 01:10:32.535
Size matters not.

698
01:10:32.572 --> 01:10:35.703
Look at me.
Judge me by my size, do you?

699
01:10:38.327 --> 01:10:41.328
And well you should not...

700
01:10:41.331 --> 01:10:44.072
for my ally is the Force.

701
01:10:44.084 --> 01:10:46.563
And a powerful ally it is.

702
01:10:47.546 --> 01:10:50.025
Life creates it...

703
01:10:50.049 --> 01:10:52.179
makes it grow.

704
01:10:52.968 --> 01:10:55.882
Its energy surrounds us...

705
01:10:56.806 --> 01:10:58.675
and binds us.

706
01:10:58.723 --> 01:11:02.073
Luminous beings are we,
not this crude matter.

707
01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:06.412
You must feel
the Force around you.

708
01:11:07.149 --> 01:11:09.845
Here, between you, me...

709
01:11:10.611 --> 01:11:12.960
the tree, the rock...

710
01:11:12.989 --> 01:11:15.163
everywhere.

711
01:11:15.199 --> 01:11:16.677
Yes...

712
01:11:16.742 --> 01:11:20.699
even between
the land and the ship.

713
01:11:25.459 --> 01:11:27.809
You want the impossible.

714
01:13:15.238 --> 01:13:17.369
I don't believe it.

715
01:13:19.285 --> 01:13:22.068
That is why you fail.

716
01:13:41.222 --> 01:13:44.614
Apology accepted,
Captain Needa.

717
01:13:52.985 --> 01:13:56.155
Lord Vader, our ships have completed
their scan and found nothing.

718
01:13:56.156 --> 01:13:58.199
<i>If the Millennium Falcon
went into light speed...</i>

719
01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:00.241
it'll be on the other side
of the galaxy now.

720
01:14:00.285 --> 01:14:02.198
Alert all commands.

721
01:14:02.245 --> 01:14:06.624
Calculate every possible destination
along their last known trajectory.

722
01:14:06.625 --> 01:14:10.146
- Yes, my lord. We'll find them.
- Don't fail me again...

723
01:14:10.962 --> 01:14:13.049
Admiral.

724
01:14:15.133 --> 01:14:18.568
Alert all commands.
Deploy the fleet.

725
01:14:33.443 --> 01:14:36.737
Captain Solo,
this time you have gone too far.

726
01:14:36.738 --> 01:14:39.949
I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

727
01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:42.080
The fleet's beginning to break up.

728
01:14:42.119 --> 01:14:45.120
Go stand by the manual release
for the landing claw.

729
01:14:47.333 --> 01:14:49.419
I really don't see
how that's going to help.

730
01:14:49.459 --> 01:14:53.046
Surrender is a perfectly acceptable
alternative in extreme circumstances.

731
01:14:53.047 --> 01:14:55.221
The Empire may be
gracious enough...

732
01:14:55.258 --> 01:14:57.780
- Thank you.
- What did you have in mind next?

733
01:14:57.802 --> 01:14:59.802
If they follow standard
imperial procedure...

734
01:14:59.845 --> 01:15:02.194
they'll dump their garbage
before they go to light speed.

735
01:15:02.223 --> 01:15:05.349
- Then we just float away.
- With the rest of the garbage.

736
01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:06.829
Then what?

737
01:15:06.894 --> 01:15:10.272
Then we gotta find a safe port
somewhere around here.

738
01:15:10.273 --> 01:15:11.708
Any ideas?

739
01:15:11.775 --> 01:15:14.253
- Where are we?
- The Anoat system.

740
01:15:14.277 --> 01:15:16.973
The Anoat system.
There's not much there.

741
01:15:16.988 --> 01:15:19.945
Oh, wait.
This is interesting.

742
01:15:19.949 --> 01:15:22.950
- Lando.
- Lando system?

743
01:15:22.952 --> 01:15:26.663
Lando's not a system.
He's a man. Lando Calrissian.

744
01:15:26.664 --> 01:15:29.013
Card player, gambler.

745
01:15:29.042 --> 01:15:31.737
- A scoundrel. You'd like him.
- Thanks.

746
01:15:31.752 --> 01:15:34.536
Bespin. It's pretty far,
but I think we can make it.

747
01:15:35.924 --> 01:15:39.099
- A mining colony?
- Yeah, a tibanna gas mine.

748
01:15:39.845 --> 01:15:42.063
Lando conned somebody out of it.

749
01:15:42.097 --> 01:15:44.924
We go back a long way,
Lando and me.

750
01:15:46.225 --> 01:15:49.009
- Can you trust him?
- No.

751
01:15:49.021 --> 01:15:52.022
But he's got no love for the Empire.
I can tell you that.

752
01:15:52.983 --> 01:15:55.724
Here we go, Chewie.
Stand by. Detach.

753
01:16:02.826 --> 01:16:04.435
You do have your moments.

754
01:16:05.245 --> 01:16:08.202
Not many of them,
but you do have them.

755
01:16:42.867 --> 01:16:44.868
Concentrate.

756
01:16:44.911 --> 01:16:48.247
Feel the Force flow.

757
01:16:48.248 --> 01:16:49.944
Yes.

758
01:16:57.549 --> 01:16:59.289
Good.

759
01:16:59.343 --> 01:17:00.778
Calm.

760
01:17:00.843 --> 01:17:02.235
Yes.

761
01:17:03.137 --> 01:17:05.791
Through the Force,
things you will see.

762
01:17:05.808 --> 01:17:09.393
Other places.
The future. The past.

763
01:17:09.394 --> 01:17:11.916
Old friends long gone.

764
01:17:22.325 --> 01:17:23.846
Control, control.

765
01:17:23.909 --> 01:17:26.215
You must learn control.

766
01:17:29.165 --> 01:17:32.209
I saw a city in the clouds.

767
01:17:34.170 --> 01:17:36.431
Friends you have there.

768
01:17:37.423 --> 01:17:41.206
- They were in pain.
- It is the future you see.

769
01:17:42.261 --> 01:17:43.305
Future?

770
01:17:52.272 --> 01:17:53.750
Will they die?

771
01:17:56.943 --> 01:17:59.119
Difficult to see.

772
01:17:59.154 --> 01:18:01.720
Always in motion is the future.

773
01:18:04.117 --> 01:18:05.595
I've gotta go to them.

774
01:18:07.537 --> 01:18:10.707
Decide you must
how to serve them best.

775
01:18:10.708 --> 01:18:13.709
If you leave now,
help them you could...

776
01:18:14.669 --> 01:18:18.367
but you would destroy all
for which they have fought and suffered.

777
01:18:32.272 --> 01:18:35.185
No, I don't have a landing permit.

778
01:18:35.190 --> 01:18:38.944
I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian.

779
01:18:38.945 --> 01:18:41.163
Wait a minute!
Let me explain!

780
01:18:41.197 --> 01:18:43.240
<i>You will not deviate
from your present course.</i>

781
01:18:43.282 --> 01:18:46.109
- Rather touchy, aren't they?
- I thought you knew this person.

782
01:18:48.913 --> 01:18:51.826
That was a long time ago.
I'm sure he's forgotten about that.

783
01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:04.052
<i>Permission granted to land
on Platform 327.</i>

784
01:19:04.053 --> 01:19:05.488
Thank you.

785
01:19:06.348 --> 01:19:09.349
Nothing to worry about.
We go way back, Lando and me.

786
01:19:09.351 --> 01:19:11.090
Who's worried?

787
01:19:59.861 --> 01:20:01.339
No one to meet us.

788
01:20:02.697 --> 01:20:05.133
I don't like this.

789
01:20:05.158 --> 01:20:08.115
- What would you like?
- They did let us land.

790
01:20:08.119 --> 01:20:10.946
Look, don't worry.
Everything's gonna be fine.

791
01:20:10.956 --> 01:20:12.651
Trust me.

792
01:20:17.337 --> 01:20:19.468
See? My friend.

793
01:20:23.802 --> 01:20:25.933
Keep your eyes open.

794
01:20:28.556 --> 01:20:30.253
Hey.

795
01:20:30.308 --> 01:20:34.520
Why, you slimy, double-crossing,
no-good swindler.

796
01:20:34.521 --> 01:20:38.914
You've got a lot of guts coming here,
after what you pulled.

797
01:20:49.245 --> 01:20:52.830
How you doin', you old pirate?
So good to see you!

798
01:20:52.831 --> 01:20:55.999
- I never thought I'd see you again.
- Well, he seems very friendly.

799
01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.212
Yes. Very friendly.

800
01:20:59.213 --> 01:21:00.909
What are you doing here?

801
01:21:00.965 --> 01:21:03.052
Repairs. I thought
you could help me out.

802
01:21:03.092 --> 01:21:05.831
- What have you done to my ship?
- Your ship?

803
01:21:05.845 --> 01:21:09.542
Hey, remember,
you lost her to me fair and square.

804
01:21:10.266 --> 01:21:11.701
How you doin', Chewbacca?

805
01:21:12.601 --> 01:21:15.385
Still hanging around with this loser?

806
01:21:17.273 --> 01:21:19.708
Hello.
What have we here?

807
01:21:21.111 --> 01:21:24.779
Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian.
I'm the administrator of this facility.

808
01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:27.825
- And who might you be?
- Leia.

809
01:21:27.826 --> 01:21:29.522
Welcome, Leia.

810
01:21:32.289 --> 01:21:35.246
All right, all right.
You old smoothie.

811
01:21:35.250 --> 01:21:39.002
Hello, sir. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

812
01:21:39.003 --> 01:21:41.917
My facilities are at your...
Well, really!

813
01:21:41.923 --> 01:21:44.403
<i>- What's wrong with the Falcon?
- Hyperdrive.</i>

814
01:21:44.427 --> 01:21:46.557
- I'll get my people to work on her.
- Good.

815
01:21:46.596 --> 01:21:48.726
That ship saved my life
quite a few times.

816
01:21:48.763 --> 01:21:51.416
She's the fastest
hunk of junk in the galaxy.

817
01:21:52.643 --> 01:21:55.209
How's the gas mine?
Still paying off for you?

818
01:21:55.229 --> 01:21:59.190
Not as well as I'd like. We're a small
outpost and not very self-sufficient.

819
01:21:59.191 --> 01:22:02.402
I've had supply problems
of every kind.

820
01:22:02.403 --> 01:22:04.663
I've had labor difficulties.

821
01:22:04.697 --> 01:22:08.073
- What's so funny?
- You. Listen to you.

822
01:22:08.074 --> 01:22:10.989
You sound like a businessman,
a responsible leader.

823
01:22:10.995 --> 01:22:12.952
Who'd have thought that, huh?

824
01:22:12.997 --> 01:22:16.042
Seeing you sure brings back
a few things.

825
01:22:16.077 --> 01:22:17.303
Yeah.

826
01:22:17.377 --> 01:22:19.593
Yeah, I'm responsible these days.

827
01:22:20.379 --> 01:22:23.163
It's the price you pay
for being successful.

828
01:22:26.303 --> 01:22:28.434
Nice to see a familiar face.

829
01:22:28.471 --> 01:22:30.167
How rude!

830
01:22:31.683 --> 01:22:33.813
That sounds like
an R2 unit in there.

831
01:22:33.851 --> 01:22:35.501
I wonder if...
Hello?

832
01:22:37.688 --> 01:22:39.298
How interesting.

833
01:22:39.358 --> 01:22:42.567
- Who are you?
- Oh, my. I'm terribly sorry.

834
01:22:42.568 --> 01:22:44.700
I didn't mean to intrude.
Please don't get up.

835
01:23:03.090 --> 01:23:05.790
Luke, you must complete the training.

836
01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:09.660
I can't keep the vision out of my head.
They're my friends. I've gotta help them.

837
01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:11.898
You must not go.

838
01:23:11.932 --> 01:23:15.149
- But Han and Leia will die if I don't.
- <i>You don't know that.</i>

839
01:23:18.021 --> 01:23:20.805
Even Yoda cannot see their fate.

840
01:23:20.816 --> 01:23:23.687
But I can help them.
I feel the Force.

841
01:23:23.694 --> 01:23:25.955
But you cannot control it.

842
01:23:26.072 --> 01:23:28.507
This is a dangerous time for you...

843
01:23:28.532 --> 01:23:31.659
when you will be tempted
by the dark side of the Force.

844
01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:35.009
Yes, yes.
To Obi-Wan you listen.

845
01:23:35.748 --> 01:23:37.226
The cave.

846
01:23:37.292 --> 01:23:39.466
Remember your failure at the cave.

847
01:23:39.503 --> 01:23:41.504
But I've learned
so much since then.

848
01:23:41.546 --> 01:23:44.328
Master Yoda, I promise to return
and finish what I've begun.

849
01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:46.385
You have my word.

850
01:23:46.425 --> 01:23:49.339
It is you and your abilities
the emperor wants.

851
01:23:49.345 --> 01:23:52.145
That is why your friends
are made to suffer.

852
01:23:53.516 --> 01:23:55.516
That's why I have to go.

853
01:23:55.800 --> 01:24:00.600
Luke, I don't want to lose you
to the emperor the way I lost Vader.

854
01:24:00.774 --> 01:24:02.334
You won't.

855
01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:06.800
Stopped they must be.
On this all depends.

856
01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:11.100
Only a fully trained Jedi knight,
with the Force as his ally...

857
01:24:11.201 --> 01:24:13.897
will conquer Vader
and his emperor.

858
01:24:13.912 --> 01:24:16.086
If you end your training now...

859
01:24:16.123 --> 01:24:20.543
if you choose the quick and easy path,
as Vader did...

860
01:24:20.544 --> 01:24:23.285
you will become an agent of evil.

861
01:24:23.297 --> 01:24:24.297
Patience.

862
01:24:25.216 --> 01:24:29.719
- And sacrifice Han and Leia?
- If you honor what they fight for...

863
01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:30.764
yes.

864
01:24:30.846 --> 01:24:34.057
If you choose to face Vader,
you will do it alone.

865
01:24:34.058 --> 01:24:36.146
I cannot interfere.

866
01:24:38.146 --> 01:24:39.407
I understand.

867
01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:47.760
R2, fire up the converters.

868
01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.500
Luke!

869
01:24:53.035 --> 01:24:55.079
Don't give in to hate.

870
01:24:55.121 --> 01:24:57.991
That leads to the dark side.

871
01:24:57.999 --> 01:24:59.782
Strong is Vader.

872
01:24:59.834 --> 01:25:02.444
Mind what you have learned.
Save you it can.

873
01:25:03.296 --> 01:25:04.862
I will.

874
01:25:04.924 --> 01:25:07.489
And I'll return. I promise.

875
01:25:14.474 --> 01:25:17.643
Told you, I did.
Reckless is he.

876
01:25:17.644 --> 01:25:19.297
Now...

877
01:25:19.354 --> 01:25:21.180
matters are worse.

878
01:25:21.231 --> 01:25:23.363
<i>That boy is our last hope.</i>

879
01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:26.444
No, there is another.

880
01:25:58.477 --> 01:26:01.897
The ship's almost finished. Two or three
more things and we're in great shape.

881
01:26:01.899 --> 01:26:04.028
The sooner the better.
Something's wrong here.

882
01:26:04.065 --> 01:26:06.197
No one has seen or knows
anything about 3PO.

883
01:26:06.235 --> 01:26:08.541
He's been gone too long
to have gotten lost.

884
01:26:08.571 --> 01:26:10.354
Relax.

885
01:26:10.406 --> 01:26:13.407
I'll talk to Lando
and see what I can find out.

886
01:26:13.409 --> 01:26:15.976
I don't trust Lando.

887
01:26:15.995 --> 01:26:19.456
Well, I don't trust him either,
but he is my friend.

888
01:26:19.457 --> 01:26:22.241
Besides, we'll soon be gone.

889
01:26:23.587 --> 01:26:25.718
Then you're as good as gone,
aren't you?

890
01:27:00.666 --> 01:27:02.226
What happened?

891
01:27:03.253 --> 01:27:04.153
Where?

892
01:27:06.089 --> 01:27:08.177
Found him in a junk pile?

893
01:27:08.215 --> 01:27:10.868
What a mess.
Chewie, you think you can repair him?

894
01:27:12.929 --> 01:27:16.581
- Lando's got people that can fix him.
- No, thanks.

895
01:27:18.017 --> 01:27:19.931
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting anything?

896
01:27:20.812 --> 01:27:21.986
Not really.

897
01:27:25.483 --> 01:27:27.570
You look absolutely beautiful.

898
01:27:27.610 --> 01:27:31.029
You truly belong here
with us among the clouds.

899
01:27:31.030 --> 01:27:32.552
Thank you.

900
01:27:32.615 --> 01:27:35.660
Would you join me
for a little refreshment?

901
01:27:35.661 --> 01:27:38.574
Everyone's invited, of course.

902
01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:40.754
Having trouble with your droid?

903
01:27:40.791 --> 01:27:43.530
No. No problem. Why?

904
01:27:52.261 --> 01:27:54.870
So you see, since we're
a small operation...

905
01:27:54.889 --> 01:27:58.265
we don't fall into
the jurisdiction of the Empire.

906
01:27:58.266 --> 01:28:00.919
- So you're part of the Mining Guild?
- No, not actually.

907
01:28:00.936 --> 01:28:03.196
Our operation is small enough
not to be noticed.

908
01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:05.000
Which is advantageous
for everybody...

909
01:28:05.010 --> 01:28:09.510
since our customers are anxious to avoid
attracting attention to themselves.

910
01:28:09.945 --> 01:28:13.945
Aren't you afraid the Empire's
gonna find out, shut you down?

911
01:28:13.949 --> 01:28:17.269
It's always been a danger that looms like
a shadow over everything we've built here.

912
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:19.670
But things have developed
that'll ensure security.

913
01:28:19.900 --> 01:28:23.300
I've just made a deal that'll keep
the Empire out of here forever.

914
01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:36.134
We would be honored
if you would join us.

915
01:28:42.896 --> 01:28:45.375
I had no choice.
They arrived right before you did.

916
01:28:46.233 --> 01:28:47.972
I'm sorry.

917
01:28:51.404 --> 01:28:52.796
I'm sorry, too.

918
01:29:07.587 --> 01:29:09.023
No, 3PO's with them.

919
01:29:10.382 --> 01:29:12.556
Just hang on.
We're almost there.

920
01:30:12.029 --> 01:30:14.595
I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't mean to intrude.

921
01:30:14.615 --> 01:30:16.658
No, please don't get up.

922
01:30:22.414 --> 01:30:25.918
Stormtroopers? Here?
We're in danger.

923
01:30:25.919 --> 01:30:28.614
I must tell the others.
Oh, no! I've been shot!

924
01:30:56.324 --> 01:30:58.020
Lord Vader.

925
01:30:58.075 --> 01:31:00.554
You may take Captain Solo
to Jabba the Hutt...

926
01:31:00.578 --> 01:31:02.665
after I have Skywalker.

927
01:31:02.705 --> 01:31:04.662
He's no good to me dead.

928
01:31:04.707 --> 01:31:08.143
He will not be
permanently damaged.

929
01:31:10.421 --> 01:31:13.074
Lord Vader, what about Leia
and the Wookiee?

930
01:31:13.091 --> 01:31:15.918
They must never again leave this city.

931
01:31:15.927 --> 01:31:19.264
That wasn't part of our agreement, nor
was giving Han to this bounty hunter!

932
01:31:19.265 --> 01:31:23.352
Perhaps you think you're
being treated unfairly?

933
01:31:25.937 --> 01:31:26.981
No.

934
01:31:27.064 --> 01:31:30.760
Good. It would be unfortunate
if I had to leave a garrison here.

935
01:31:33.028 --> 01:31:35.508
This deal is getting worse
all the time.

936
01:31:36.615 --> 01:31:39.095
Oh, yes, that's very good.
I like that.

937
01:31:40.618 --> 01:31:43.271
Something's not right
because now I can't see.

938
01:31:45.708 --> 01:31:48.012
That's much better.

939
01:31:48.044 --> 01:31:49.740
Wait. Wait.

940
01:31:49.796 --> 01:31:51.927
Oh, my!
What have you done?

941
01:31:51.964 --> 01:31:53.573
I'm backwards!

942
01:31:53.633 --> 01:31:55.589
You flea-bitten furball!

943
01:31:55.634 --> 01:31:58.418
Only an overgrown mophead like you
would be stupid enough...

944
01:32:12.903 --> 01:32:14.947
I feel terrible.

945
01:32:30.128 --> 01:32:32.259
Why are they doing this?

946
01:32:34.675 --> 01:32:37.458
They never even asked me
any questions.

947
01:32:46.687 --> 01:32:48.949
- Get out of here, Lando.
- Shut up and listen.

948
01:32:48.981 --> 01:32:52.192
Vader's agreed
to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.

949
01:32:52.193 --> 01:32:54.150
They'll have to stay here,
but they'll be safe.

950
01:32:54.195 --> 01:32:56.413
- And Han?
- Vader's given him to the bounty hunter.

951
01:32:56.447 --> 01:32:58.970
- Vader wants us all dead.
- He doesn't want you at all.

952
01:32:58.991 --> 01:33:02.494
He's after somebody
called Skywalker.

953
01:33:02.495 --> 01:33:05.147
- Lord Vader set a trap for him.
- And we're the bait.

954
01:33:05.164 --> 01:33:07.077
- He's on his way.
- Perfect.

955
01:33:07.959 --> 01:33:10.264
You fixed us all real good,
didn't you?

956
01:33:10.294 --> 01:33:11.512
My friend.

957
01:33:14.466 --> 01:33:15.728
Stop!

958
01:33:16.968 --> 01:33:19.228
I've done all I can.

959
01:33:19.262 --> 01:33:21.784
Sorry I couldn't do better,
but I got my own problems.

960
01:33:21.806 --> 01:33:23.154
Yeah.

961
01:33:23.224 --> 01:33:25.137
You're a real hero.

962
01:33:35.861 --> 01:33:38.427
You certainly
have a way with people.

963
01:33:52.713 --> 01:33:54.626
This facility is crude...

964
01:33:54.673 --> 01:33:57.885
but it should be adequate
to freeze Skywalker...

965
01:33:57.886 --> 01:34:00.233
for his journey to the emperor.

966
01:34:00.261 --> 01:34:03.389
Lord Vader,
ship approaching, X-wing class.

967
01:34:03.390 --> 01:34:06.912
Good. Monitor Skywalker
and allow him to land.

968
01:34:08.312 --> 01:34:13.150
Lord Vader, we only use this facility
for carbon freezing. It might kill him.

969
01:34:13.151 --> 01:34:16.151
I do not want
the emperor's prize damaged.

970
01:34:16.153 --> 01:34:19.371
We will test it on Captain Solo.

971
01:34:43.014 --> 01:34:47.351
If you'd attached my legs I wouldn't
be in this ridiculous position.

972
01:34:47.352 --> 01:34:50.135
Now remember, Chewbacca,
you have a responsibility for me...

973
01:34:50.147 --> 01:34:51.930
so don't do anything foolish.

974
01:35:05.955 --> 01:35:08.085
What's going on, buddy?

975
01:35:08.958 --> 01:35:11.131
You're being put into carbon freeze.

976
01:35:11.167 --> 01:35:14.796
What if he doesn't survive?
He's worth a lot to me.

977
01:35:14.797 --> 01:35:18.320
The Empire will compensate you
if he dies. Put him in.

978
01:35:22.137 --> 01:35:23.355
Chewbacca, stop!

979
01:35:23.430 --> 01:35:25.517
No, Chewie, stop!

980
01:35:25.557 --> 01:35:28.685
You're going to get us all killed!
Yes, stop. I'm not ready to die.

981
01:35:28.686 --> 01:35:30.729
Hey! Hey!
Listen to me.

982
01:35:30.771 --> 01:35:33.381
Chewie, this won't help me.

983
01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:36.096
Hey, save your strength.
There'll be another time.

984
01:35:37.862 --> 01:35:39.557
The princess.

985
01:35:39.613 --> 01:35:41.440
You have to take care of her.

986
01:35:43.618 --> 01:35:45.705
Do you hear me?

987
01:35:59.509 --> 01:36:02.597
- I love you.
- I know.

988
01:36:31.667 --> 01:36:35.406
What's going on?
Turn round. I can't see.

989
01:37:34.147 --> 01:37:36.279
They've encased him in carbonite.

990
01:37:36.316 --> 01:37:38.273
He should be quite
well-protected...

991
01:37:38.318 --> 01:37:40.319
if he survived
the freezing process, that is.

992
01:37:40.362 --> 01:37:42.971
Well, Calrissian, did he survive?

993
01:37:42.991 --> 01:37:44.686
Yes, he's alive.

994
01:37:45.492 --> 01:37:47.450
And in perfect hibernation.

995
01:37:48.329 --> 01:37:50.547
He's all yours, bounty hunter.

996
01:37:51.332 --> 01:37:53.115
Reset the chamber for Skywalker.

997
01:37:55.461 --> 01:37:57.376
Skywalker has just landed, lord.

998
01:37:57.422 --> 01:38:01.462
Good. See to it
that he finds his way in here.

999
01:38:05.555 --> 01:38:07.355
Calrissian...

1000
01:38:07.557 --> 01:38:10.057
take the princess
and the Wookiee to my ship.

1001
01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:12.360
You said they'd be left in
the city under my supervision.

1002
01:38:12.362 --> 01:38:14.162
I am altering the deal.

1003
01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:17.026
Pray I don't alter it any further.

1004
01:39:54.499 --> 01:39:57.152
Luke, don't! It's a trap!

1005
01:39:58.545 --> 01:39:59.676
It's a trap!

1006
01:40:46.053 --> 01:40:48.531
The Force is with you,
young Skywalker.

1007
01:40:50.849 --> 01:40:52.980
But you are not a Jedi yet.

1008
01:41:54.914 --> 01:41:56.611
Well done.

1009
01:41:58.333 --> 01:42:01.248
Hold them in the security tower.
And keep it quiet.

1010
01:42:01.254 --> 01:42:02.993
Move.

1011
01:42:07.385 --> 01:42:10.805
- What do you think you're doing?
- We're getting out of here.

1012
01:42:10.806 --> 01:42:12.632
I knew all along.
It had to be a mistake.

1013
01:42:12.683 --> 01:42:15.640
Do you think that
after what you did to Han...

1014
01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:19.939
- I had no choice.
- What are you doing? Trust him!

1015
01:42:19.940 --> 01:42:23.067
We understand, don't we, Chewie?
He had no choice.

1016
01:42:23.068 --> 01:42:24.678
I'm just trying to help.

1017
01:42:24.737 --> 01:42:27.475
We don't need any of your help.

1018
01:42:32.494 --> 01:42:34.060
What?

1019
01:42:34.122 --> 01:42:38.906
- It sounds like Han.
- There's still a chance to save Han...

1020
01:42:39.668 --> 01:42:43.061
at the east... platform.

1021
01:42:47.134 --> 01:42:49.352
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1022
01:42:49.386 --> 01:42:51.213
After all, he's only a Wookiee.

1023
01:42:52.098 --> 01:42:54.881
Put Captain Solo
in the cargo hold.

1024
01:43:09.990 --> 01:43:12.339
R2, where have you been?

1025
01:43:12.369 --> 01:43:14.326
Wait. Turn around, you woolly...

1026
01:43:15.455 --> 01:43:18.326
Hurry! We're trying to save
Han from the bounty hunter.

1027
01:43:20.962 --> 01:43:23.483
Well, at least
you're still in one piece.

1028
01:43:23.505 --> 01:43:25.940
Look what's happened to me.

1029
01:43:37.811 --> 01:43:40.507
Oh, no!
Chewie, they're behind you!

1030
01:43:53.369 --> 01:43:55.804
You have learned much, young one.

1031
01:43:55.829 --> 01:43:58.047
You'll find I'm full of surprises.

1032
01:44:09.552 --> 01:44:12.770
Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker.

1033
01:44:13.514 --> 01:44:16.081
Obi-Wan knew this to be true.

1034
01:44:24.066 --> 01:44:25.458
All too easy.

1035
01:44:30.657 --> 01:44:33.223
Perhaps you're not as strong
as the emperor thought.

1036
01:44:36.288 --> 01:44:37.985
Impressive.

1037
01:44:39.875 --> 01:44:41.354
Most impressive.

1038
01:44:49.176 --> 01:44:53.002
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
You have controlled your fear.

1039
01:44:55.642 --> 01:44:58.976
Now, release your anger.

1040
01:44:58.977 --> 01:45:01.673
Only your hatred can destroy me.

1041
01:47:12.531 --> 01:47:14.532
The security code
has been changed.

1042
01:47:14.575 --> 01:47:18.010
R2, you can tell the computer
to override the security systems.

1043
01:47:18.829 --> 01:47:20.611
R2, hurry.

1044
01:47:23.833 --> 01:47:26.225
<i>Attention.
This is Lando Calrissian. Attention.</i>

1045
01:47:26.253 --> 01:47:28.297
<i>The Empire has taken control
of the city.</i>

1046
01:47:28.339 --> 01:47:31.296
<i>I advise everyone to leave
before more imperial troops arrive.</i>

1047
01:47:37.682 --> 01:47:39.377
This way.

1048
01:47:39.433 --> 01:47:41.738
Well, don't blame me.
I'm an interpreter.

1049
01:47:41.770 --> 01:47:44.771
I'm not supposed to know a power socket
from a computer terminal.

1050
01:48:06.252 --> 01:48:09.296
<i>We're not interested in the hyperdrive
on the Falcon. It's fixed!</i>

1051
01:48:14.177 --> 01:48:17.091
Just open the door,
you stupid lump!

1052
01:48:25.564 --> 01:48:28.086
I never doubted you for a second.
Wonderful!

1053
01:48:52.508 --> 01:48:55.335
That hurts! Bend down,
you thoughtless... Ow!

1054
01:49:02.352 --> 01:49:03.787
Go!

1055
01:49:10.152 --> 01:49:13.065
I thought that hairy beast
would be the end of me.

1056
01:49:13.071 --> 01:49:15.028
Of course I've looked better.

1057
01:50:08.628 --> 01:50:12.422
You are beaten.
It is useless to resist.

1058
01:50:12.423 --> 01:50:16.076
Don't let yourself be destroyed
as Obi-Wan did.

1059
01:50:31.735 --> 01:50:33.430
There is no escape.

1060
01:50:34.237 --> 01:50:36.455
Don't make me destroy you.

1061
01:50:40.368 --> 01:50:43.238
You do not yet realize
your importance.

1062
01:50:43.247 --> 01:50:46.031
You have only begun
to discover your power.

1063
01:50:46.041 --> 01:50:47.955
Join me...

1064
01:50:48.002 --> 01:50:50.480
and I will complete your training.

1065
01:50:50.504 --> 01:50:52.983
With our combined strength...

1066
01:50:53.006 --> 01:50:56.051
we can end
this destructive conflict...

1067
01:50:56.052 --> 01:50:58.444
and bring order to the galaxy.

1068
01:50:58.471 --> 01:51:01.080
I'll never join you!

1069
01:51:01.098 --> 01:51:05.309
If you only knew the power
of the dark side.

1070
01:51:05.310 --> 01:51:09.648
Obi-Wan never told you
what happened to your father.

1071
01:51:09.649 --> 01:51:11.128
He told me enough.

1072
01:51:13.694 --> 01:51:15.607
He told me you killed him.

1073
01:51:17.324 --> 01:51:19.497
I am your father.

1074
01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:29.960
That's not true.

1075
01:51:30.753 --> 01:51:32.450
That's impossible!

1076
01:51:32.506 --> 01:51:35.897
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.

1077
01:51:44.601 --> 01:51:48.853
You can destroy the emperor.
He has foreseen this.

1078
01:51:48.855 --> 01:51:51.856
It is your destiny.

1079
01:51:51.858 --> 01:51:53.642
Join me...

1080
01:51:53.694 --> 01:51:58.174
and together we can rule the galaxy
as father and son.

1081
01:52:08.625 --> 01:52:10.322
Come with me.

1082
01:52:11.129 --> 01:52:13.390
It is the only way.

1083
01:53:19.573 --> 01:53:21.009
Ben.

1084
01:53:21.825 --> 01:53:23.740
Ben, please.

1085
01:53:51.606 --> 01:53:53.259
Hear me.

1086
01:54:00.156 --> 01:54:02.287
- We've got to go back.
- What?

1087
01:54:02.326 --> 01:54:04.761
- I know where Luke is.
- What about those fighters?

1088
01:54:05.787 --> 01:54:08.135
Chewie, just do it.

1089
01:54:08.164 --> 01:54:09.947
All right, all right!

1090
01:54:18.092 --> 01:54:22.310
Alert my Stardestroyer
to prepare for my arrival.

1091
01:54:32.690 --> 01:54:34.822
Look, someone's up there.

1092
01:54:35.984 --> 01:54:38.551
It's Luke.
Chewie, slow down.

1093
01:54:38.571 --> 01:54:42.006
We'll get under him.
Lando, open the top hatch.

1094
01:54:57.799 --> 01:55:00.235
Okay. Easy, Chewie.

1095
01:55:21.906 --> 01:55:24.124
<i>- Lando?
- Okay, let's go.</i>

1096
01:55:44.097 --> 01:55:45.576
All right, Chewie. Let's go.

1097
01:56:21.093 --> 01:56:23.006
I'll be back.

1098
01:56:28.683 --> 01:56:30.118
Stardestroyer.

1099
01:56:35.316 --> 01:56:37.881
All right, Chewie.
Ready for light speed.

1100
01:56:37.902 --> 01:56:40.032
If your people fixed the hyperdrive.

1101
01:56:40.070 --> 01:56:42.505
All the coordinates are set.
It's now or never.

1102
01:56:42.531 --> 01:56:44.053
Punch it!

1103
01:56:54.668 --> 01:56:57.059
They told me they fixed it.

1104
01:56:57.086 --> 01:56:59.044
I trusted them!

1105
01:56:59.088 --> 01:57:01.698
It's not my fault!

1106
01:57:07.223 --> 01:57:09.963
They'll be in range
of our tractor beam in moments, lord.

1107
01:57:09.976 --> 01:57:13.645
<i>Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive
on the Millennium Falcon?</i>

1108
01:57:13.646 --> 01:57:15.734
- Yes, my lord.
- Good.

1109
01:57:15.773 --> 01:57:19.525
Prepare the boarding party
and set your weapons for stun.

1110
01:57:19.526 --> 01:57:22.658
- Yes, my lord. Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

1111
01:57:24.114 --> 01:57:27.534
Noisy brute. Why don't we
just go into light speed?

1112
01:57:27.535 --> 01:57:29.187
We can't?

1113
01:57:29.246 --> 01:57:31.724
How would you know
the hyperdrive is deactivated?

1114
01:57:34.918 --> 01:57:37.919
The city's central computer told you?

1115
01:57:37.921 --> 01:57:40.791
R2-D2, you know better
than to trust a strange computer.

1116
01:57:40.798 --> 01:57:44.234
Ouch! Pay attention
to what you're doing.

1117
01:57:56.398 --> 01:57:57.616
Father.

1118
01:57:59.443 --> 01:58:01.662
Son, come with me.

1119
01:58:04.615 --> 01:58:06.093
Ben.

1120
01:58:07.118 --> 01:58:09.292
Why didn't you tell me?

1121
01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:28.691
It's Vader.

1122
01:58:34.478 --> 01:58:38.219
Luke, it is your destiny.

1123
01:58:45.782 --> 01:58:48.131
Why didn't you tell me?

1124
01:58:54.332 --> 01:58:58.420
Alert all commands.
Ready for the tractor beam.

1125
01:59:01.715 --> 01:59:04.585
R2, come back at once!
You haven't finished with me yet.

1126
01:59:04.593 --> 01:59:08.220
You don't know how to fix the
hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it.

1127
01:59:08.221 --> 01:59:12.832
I'm standing here in pieces
and you're having delusions of grandeur!

1128
01:59:15.813 --> 01:59:17.334
You did it!

1129
02:00:14.998 --> 02:00:18.130
<i>- Luke, we're ready for take-off.
- Good luck, Lando.</i>

1130
02:00:19.043 --> 02:00:23.131
<i>When we find Jabba the Hutt and
that bounty hunter, we'll contact you.</i>

1131
02:00:23.132 --> 02:00:25.871
I'll meet you at
the rendezvous point on Tatooine.

1132
02:00:25.885 --> 02:00:29.429
Princess, we'll find Han.
I promise.

1133
02:00:29.430 --> 02:00:31.734
Chewie, I'll be waiting
for your signal.

1134
02:00:31.765 --> 02:00:33.548
Take care, you two.

1135
02:00:33.601 --> 02:00:35.731
<i>May the Force be with you.</i>
