I studied at Oxford and Harvard.

One million landmines and
my hovercrafts float right over them.

And how do you propose to kill me now,
Mr. Bond?

33
00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:51.720
It's pathetic that you British still believe
you have the right to police the world.

34
00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:56.642
But you will not live to see the day

I heard of this place.

483
01:00:57.404 --> 01:00:59.238
Never thought I'd find myself here.

484
01:01:00.407 --> 01:01:02.408
Some things are best kept underground.

485
01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:07.454
Abandoned station for abandoned agents.

486
01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:13.460
- Your calling card.
- So, what have you got on Graves?

487
01:01:14.921 --> 01:01:15.921
You burn me

488
01:01:17.591 --> 01:01:20.801
- and now you want my help?
- What did you expect, an apology?

489
01:01:20.886 --> 01:01:24.638
I know you'll do whatever it takes
to get the job done.

490
01:01:24.723 --> 01:01:27.516
- Just like you.
- The difference is, I won't compromise.

491
01:01:28.226 --> 01:01:31.270
Well, I don't have the luxury of
seeing things as black and white.

492
01:01:32.647 --> 01:01:35.649
- While you were away, the world changed.
- Not for me.

493
01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:42.990
You're suspicious of Graves,
or I wouldn't be here right now.

494
01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:48.746
- So, what do you have?
- Nothing beyond the official biography.

495
01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:51.457
Orphan working
in an Argentinean diamond mine,

496
01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:56.003
learns engineering, makes a huge find
in Iceland and gives half of it to charity.

497
01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:59.965
From nothing to everything
in no time at all.

498
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:06.555
- And his demonstration this weekend?
- Probably just another publicity stunt.

499
01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:09.350
Now, tell me what you know
about this Cuban clinic.

500
01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:14.980
Gene therapy. New identities
courtesy of DNA transplants.

501
01:02:16.316 --> 01:02:17.858
So-called beauty parlor.

502
01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:21.570
We'd heard rumors of such a place.
I didn't think it really existed.

503
01:02:23.031 --> 01:02:24.657
It doesn't anymore.

504
01:02:25.158 --> 01:02:29.119
Zao got away, but he left these behind.

505
01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:34.166
All from Gustav Graves' mine.

506
01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:39.672
I think it's a front for laundering
African conflict diamonds.

507
01:02:40.882 --> 01:02:45.010
We need to tread carefully.
Graves is politically connected.

508
01:02:46.846 --> 01:02:48.639
Lucky I'm on the outside, then.

509
01:02:49.266 --> 01:02:51.475
Well, it seems you've become useful again.

510
01:02:55.188 --> 01:02:58.023
Then maybe it's time
you let me get on with my job.

(GUNS FIRING)

512
01:04:18.563 --> 01:04:21.607
Forgive my mentioning it, 007,
but a perfect marksman

513
01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:23.901
isn't really supposed
to shoot his own boss.

514
01:04:27.489 --> 01:04:29.073
Check the replay.

515
01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:33.035
You'll find he's dead,
and she's only got a flesh wound.

516
01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:37.039
There's always an excuse,
isn't there, double-0 zero?

517
01:04:37.916 --> 01:04:40.793
Give me the old firing range any day,
Quartermaster.

518
01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.462
Yes, but it's called the future,
so get used to it.

519
01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:48.092
So this is where they keep
the old relics, then, eh?

520
01:04:49.344 --> 01:04:53.138
I'll have you know this is where our most
cutting-edge technology is developed.

521
01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:56.558
- Point taken.
- Must you touch everything?

522
01:04:56.643 --> 01:04:57.810
Does this still work?

523
01:05:04.275 --> 01:05:07.778
- Now, look...
- So where is this cutting-edge stuff?

524
01:05:08.655 --> 01:05:10.489
I'm trying to get to it.

Hmm. Still, better than looking cleverer
than you are. Follow me, please.

This will be your 20th, I believe.

- Yes, well, 007,

You must be joking.

As I learned from my predecessor, Bond,
I never joke about my work.

- Very good.
- Adaptive camouflage.

Tiny cameras on all sides
project the image they see

onto a light-emitting polymer skin
on the opposite side.

You see, to the casual eye,
it's as good as invisible.

Why don't you acquaint yourself
with the manual?

Should be able to shoot through that
in a couple of hours.

Just took a few seconds, Q.

Before you leave on
your mission for Iceland,

556
01:07:12.487 --> 01:07:14.404
tell me what you know of James Bond.

557
01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:18.534
He's a double-0,
and a wild one, as I discovered today.

558
01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:22.538
He'll light the fuse on
any explosive situation

559
01:07:22.622 --> 01:07:26.792
and be a danger to himself and others.
Kill first, ask questions later.

560
01:07:27.335 --> 01:07:28.961
I think he's a blunt instrument
whose primary method

561
01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:30.921
is to provoke and confront.

562
01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:33.006
A man nobody can get close to.

563
01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:35.717
A womanizer.

564
01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:38.428
Well, you're going to be seeing
a lot more of him in Iceland.

565
01:07:40.431 --> 01:07:43.308
With great respect,
a man like him could blow my cover.

you volunteered for this operation,

567
01:07:48.147 --> 01:07:50.774
but in three months,
you've turned up next to nothing.

Graves seems to be clean.

569
01:07:53.278 --> 01:07:54.570
Well, Bond thinks differently,

570
01:07:54.654 --> 01:07:57.990
so I'm going to let him do
what you so ably described,

571
01:07:58.074 --> 01:08:00.325
mix things up a little with Mr. Graves.

572
01:08:00.827 --> 01:08:03.870
And with you there,
things won't be able to get out of hand.

573
01:08:05.456 --> 01:08:06.915
In your three years in cryptology,

574
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.043
you've managed to keep
business and pleasure separate.

575
01:08:10.128 --> 01:08:15.507
You haven't fraternized with any of your
fellow agents, despite several advances.

576
01:08:16.509 --> 01:08:19.845
I think it would be foolish to get involved
with someone within the community.

Glad you could make it, Mr. Bond.
How did you like my run?

583
01:09:41.886 --> 01:09:44.179
Looked like a man on the edge
of losing control.

584
01:09:44.263 --> 01:09:47.265
It's only by being on the edge
that we know who we really are,

- Yeah, but he died chasing a dream.

- I'd rather not go at all.

you live them.

One of the virtues of never sleeping,

I'm still not quite sure how good you are.

954
02:08:05.177 --> 02:08:08.012
I am so good.

955
02:08:09.682 --> 02:08:11.599
Especially when you're bad.

(DIE ANOTHER DAY PLAYING)

958
02:08:50.764 --> 02:08:54.267
(SINGING) I'm gonna wake up
Yes and no

959
02:08:54.351 --> 02:08:58.104
I'm gonna kiss Some part of

960
02:08:58.314 --> 02:09:01.983
I'm gonna keep this secret

961
02:09:02.067 --> 02:09:05.653
I'm gonna close my body now

962
02:09:17.208 --> 02:09:21.002
I'm gonna break the cycle

963

I'm gonna shake up the system

964

I'm gonna destroy my ego

I'm gonna close my body now

966

My body now

967
02:10:17.726 --> 02:10:25.726
I guess I'll die another day

968
02:11:03.147 --> 02:11:06.858
I'm gonna avoid the cliche

969
02:11:06.942 --> 02:11:10.528
I'm gonna suspend my senses

970
02:11:10.738 --> 02:11:14.407
I'm gonna delay my pleasure

971
02:11:14.533 --> 02:11:18.119
I'm gonna close my body now

972
02:11:20.164 --> 02:11:22.164
My body now

973
02:11:50.819 --> 02:11:52.819
Another day

974
02:12:18.305 --> 02:12:20.431
(LAUGHING)

975
02:12:22.183 --> 02:12:24.310
