Three euro.

00:01:29.213 --> 00:01:30.248
Two. I'll give it for two.

00:01:32.015 --> 00:01:32.983

Morgan, you're such
a fucking freak. I love you.

15
00:03:12.351 --> 00:03:15.184
- I love you.
- Where'd you steal that microphone from?

16
00:03:15.186 --> 00:03:17.354
<i>Audrey, you know me. You know
that I own microphones.</i>

17
00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:22.827
Fuck me! Tess is here.

18
00:03:24.795 --> 00:03:27.865
- Oh, my God!
- The audacity.

19
00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.301
- Morgan...
- The sheer hubris

20
00:03:31.303 --> 00:03:33.069
to show up here
at your birthday.

21
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:35.071
- Morgan...
- There was a minimum

22
00:03:35.073 --> 00:03:36.872
number of people
in order to reserve the bar.

23
00:03:36.874 --> 00:03:38.508
- Morgan...
- I'm so sorry. Oh, my God!

24
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.942
I didn't think she would come.

25
00:03:39.944 --> 00:03:41.478
Oh, she's ordering
a custom cocktail.

26
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.878
I'm gonna kill myself.

27
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.081
What do I say? Huh? Like,

28
00:03:45.083 --> 00:03:46.916
"My boyfriend dumped me
in a text message."

29
00:03:46.918 --> 00:03:48.884
- How do I explain that?
- I know.

30
00:03:48.886 --> 00:03:50.887
There's a simple solution.
It's called lying.

31
00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.356
No. I'm a really bad liar.

32
00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:55.525
I know, 'cause you ramble.
You give too many details.

33
00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:57.060
And then people know
that you're lying.

34
00:03:57.062 --> 00:03:58.495
You have to be concise
about it.

35
00:03:58.497 --> 00:04:00.931
Here, ask me
what I've been up to lately.

36
00:04:00.933 --> 00:04:03.934
- Um, what have you been up to?
- I bought a boat. And we're out.

37
00:04:03.936 --> 00:04:05.769
Oh, my God. She's coming over here.
I'm with you.

38
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:07.103
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

39
00:04:07.105 --> 00:04:08.772
Hey, ladies!

40
00:04:08.774 --> 00:04:10.907
- I can't do this.
- Oh, you're fucking dead to me!

41
00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:12.108
Happy birthday!

42
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.212
Hey, girl!

43
00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:16.112
Where's your
adorable boyfriend?

44
00:04:17.216 --> 00:04:19.983
You know, you guys make
such a surprising couple.

45
00:04:19.985 --> 00:04:22.385
Like, if I didn't meet him
as your boyfriend,

46
00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:25.188
I would assume he'd be dating
someone more...

47
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.993
Like, edgy. Like a cool girl.
Like a model.

48
00:04:29.061 --> 00:04:30.527
But then
I see you two together,

49
00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:32.164
and it's like,
"Aw, this works too."

50
00:04:33.298 --> 00:04:34.766
Where is he?
So I can hug him.

51
00:04:50.383 --> 00:04:51.183
Okay.

52
00:04:53.553 --> 00:04:54.753
Okay.

53
00:04:55.421 --> 00:04:57.155
Oh, God. Oh, come on.

54
00:05:28.521 --> 00:05:31.222
This is crazy because
you're from the Ukraine...

55
00:05:31.224 --> 00:05:32.956
...and I just auditioned

56
00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:36.027
to be a Ukrainian farm girl
in a GEICO ad.

57
00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:37.128
- And?
- They told me

58
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.965
I was too authentic.
Anyway...

59
00:05:39.898 --> 00:05:41.865
Is it Ukraine or the Ukraine?

60
00:05:41.867 --> 00:05:43.167
Well, it depends.

61
00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:44.502
You say how you like,
you know?

62
00:05:44.504 --> 00:05:47.338
Always let beautiful,
sexy woman decide.

63
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.873
Okay.

64
00:05:48.875 --> 00:05:50.007
That's what this is?

65
00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:51.876
- You know...
- All right.

66
00:05:51.878 --> 00:05:53.046
You have face like doll.

67
00:05:53.446 --> 00:05:54.345
Mmm. Okay.

68
00:05:54.347 --> 00:05:56.914
Such a small, narrow waist.
It's tiny.

69
00:05:56.916 --> 00:05:58.349
You know,
I was gonna drive home,

70
00:05:58.351 --> 00:06:00.987
but now I think I might
just drive into a wall.

71
00:06:01.921 --> 00:06:02.588
Hit me.

72
00:06:03.623 --> 00:06:05.158
Wait, I can use this.

73
00:06:05.925 --> 00:06:07.091
Come here.

74
00:06:07.093 --> 00:06:08.426
- Audrey.
- Yeah?

75
00:06:08.428 --> 00:06:10.394
This is Viktor. He's a
visitor from Eastern Europe.

76
00:06:10.396 --> 00:06:12.163
He has something that
he wants to say to you.

77
00:06:12.165 --> 00:06:13.531
- I do?
- Yeah, yeah.

78
00:06:13.533 --> 00:06:16.100
This is my best friend.
She's having a bad night.

79
00:06:16.102 --> 00:06:18.469
Can you just use
your aggressive masculinity

80
00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:20.271
for good instead of for evil?

81
00:06:20.273 --> 00:06:22.173
Just tell her
what you told me before.

82
00:06:22.175 --> 00:06:23.240
What are you doing?

83
00:06:23.242 --> 00:06:26.177
You have doll face.

84
00:06:26.179 --> 00:06:27.579
No, make it specific to her.

85
00:06:27.581 --> 00:06:29.113
Like really
objectify her.

86
00:06:29.115 --> 00:06:30.214
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

87
00:06:30.216 --> 00:06:32.283
Okay, cool. Uh...

88
00:06:32.285 --> 00:06:34.486
You have big baby eyes.

89
00:06:34.488 --> 00:06:37.388
- Mmm.
- And, phew, soft...

90
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.324
- Supple udders. Yeah.
- Oh.

91
00:06:40.326 --> 00:06:42.093
- Oh, my God! What the fuck?
- Wow!

92
00:06:42.095 --> 00:06:43.562
Thank you so much, Viktor.

93
00:06:43.564 --> 00:06:44.962
- You've done good work.
- Okay.

94
00:06:44.964 --> 00:06:46.498
- Thank you so much.
- Okay, bye-bye.

95
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.132
I fucking hate you.

96
00:06:48.134 --> 00:06:50.101
Oh, come on! You're smiling.

97
00:06:50.103 --> 00:06:51.235
Hey, Audrey.
Where's Drew?

98
00:06:51.237 --> 00:06:52.504
He drowned.

99
00:06:52.506 --> 00:06:54.539
Ugh. Do you see?
This has been all night long.

100
00:06:54.541 --> 00:06:56.040
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

101
00:06:56.042 --> 00:06:57.208
- You have to move on.
- Yes, I know.

102
00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.976
It's just really hard
to do that

103
00:06:58.978 --> 00:07:01.346
when he left a box of his shit
in our apartment,

104
00:07:01.348 --> 00:07:02.947
and he won't even text me back
about picking it up.

105
00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:04.249
I know.

106
00:07:04.251 --> 00:07:06.050
- Oh, can I see your phone?
- Yeah.

107
00:07:06.052 --> 00:07:07.388
I just have to
Google something.

108
00:07:12.992 --> 00:07:14.959
Whew!

109
00:07:16.963 --> 00:07:18.996
Who are you texting?

110
00:07:18.998 --> 00:07:21.433
Morgan, let me see my phone.

111
00:07:21.435 --> 00:07:22.734
- I'm texting Drew.
- Oh, my God!

112
00:07:22.736 --> 00:07:24.970
I said, "Fuck you,
you worthless nutsack.

113
00:07:24.972 --> 00:07:26.138
"I'm setting your shit
on fire."

114
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.173
Oh, my God, no!

115
00:07:28.175 --> 00:07:30.008
Why the fuck
would you write that?

116
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.545
'Cause we're gonna
set his shit on fire.

117
00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.261
Fuck!

118
00:07:52.633 --> 00:07:53.700
Really, Drew?

119
00:07:54.736 --> 00:07:57.135
Skid marks
on your underwear?

120
00:07:57.137 --> 00:07:58.437
What are you, eight?

121
00:07:58.439 --> 00:08:00.038
Did he want me to wash them?

122
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.440
Is that why
he broke up with me?

123
00:08:01.442 --> 00:08:03.108
'Cause I didn't
mother him enough?

124
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:04.278
Fuck you. Wipe your own ass.

125
00:08:05.212 --> 00:08:06.313
Okay. Oh, what's this?

126
00:08:06.781 --> 00:08:08.447
Oh.

127
00:08:08.449 --> 00:08:10.716
This is actually
a handwritten list

128
00:08:10.718 --> 00:08:13.385
of his favorite breakfast
burrito places in Los Angeles.

129
00:08:13.387 --> 00:08:15.621
- Stop! He made notes.
- Yep.

130
00:08:15.623 --> 00:08:17.458
"Great egg to tortilla ratio."

131
00:08:18.125 --> 00:08:19.458
Fuckin' idiot.

132
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:21.159
- Burn the fire.
- Burn!

133
00:08:21.161 --> 00:08:23.161
Oh, my God! His trophy.

134
00:08:23.163 --> 00:08:24.664
Second place trophy,
fantasy football.

135
00:08:24.666 --> 00:08:26.298
And he saved it.

136
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.300
No! It's not
even real football.

137
00:08:28.302 --> 00:08:29.769
It's a fucking fantasy!

138
00:08:29.771 --> 00:08:31.069
Oh, wait.

139
00:08:34.074 --> 00:08:34.975
Oh, my God. It's Drew.

140
00:08:43.785 --> 00:08:45.018
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey.

141
00:08:46.186 --> 00:08:48.186
Really? That's it? "Hey"?

142
00:08:48.188 --> 00:08:50.492
Are your ears burning?
'Cause your shit is.

143
00:08:51.693 --> 00:08:53.428
I'm sorry. I fucked up, okay?

144
00:08:53.795 --> 00:08:56.094
<i>Hold on. What?</i>

145
00:08:56.096 --> 00:08:58.698
What do you mean,
you fucked up? Which part?

146
00:08:58.700 --> 00:08:59.665
I'm gonna come over tomorrow,

147
00:08:59.667 --> 00:09:01.467
and I'm going to
explain everything, okay?

148
00:09:01.469 --> 00:09:03.402
Please don't do anything
with my stuff.

149
00:09:03.404 --> 00:09:04.704
I'll be back tomorrow.

150
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:08.207
Drew?

151
00:09:10.245 --> 00:09:11.246
Drew!

152
00:10:00.461 --> 00:10:01.764
(INDISTINCT CHATTER

153
00:10:07.235 --> 00:10:08.436
- Oh! I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

154
00:10:09.638 --> 00:10:10.438
Happy birthday.

155
00:10:11.239 --> 00:10:12.240
How...

156
00:10:14.443 --> 00:10:16.275
- Yep.
- The... Yeah.

157
00:10:16.277 --> 00:10:18.277
- Uh, it's not my birthday.
- Oh.

158
00:10:18.279 --> 00:10:19.613
I just kinda wear it
for warmth.

159
00:10:19.615 --> 00:10:21.417
Well, if it was your birthday,
I would say, um...

160
00:10:23.619 --> 00:10:25.318
"Happy birthday."

161
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.722
Well, I'd probably say,
"Thank you."

162
00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:28.591
You're welcome.

163
00:10:29.758 --> 00:10:30.759
Hey.

164
00:10:31.827 --> 00:10:33.827
I got a quarter left.

165
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:37.464
Your mission, should you
choose to accept it,

166
00:10:37.466 --> 00:10:41.169
is to find the absolute
worst song on the jukebox.

167
00:10:42.905 --> 00:10:44.172
Okay.

168
00:10:57.186 --> 00:10:57.820
One gum, please.

169
00:10:58.954 --> 00:11:00.255
Oh.

170
00:11:00.889 --> 00:11:02.489
Yeah.

171
00:11:05.628 --> 00:11:06.760
Um...

172
00:11:06.762 --> 00:11:07.763
$2.25.

173
00:11:17.439 --> 00:11:18.474
Have a great day.

174
00:11:19.842 --> 00:11:22.478
Aren't you gonna ask me
if I need help to my car?

175
00:11:26.749 --> 00:11:27.549
So, um...

176
00:11:28.818 --> 00:11:29.618
Where are you from?

177
00:11:29.986 --> 00:11:31.284
Uh...

178
00:11:31.286 --> 00:11:32.754
England.

179
00:11:32.756 --> 00:11:34.254
That's what I thought.

180
00:11:34.256 --> 00:11:35.890
Yeah, but sometimes
when I think that

181
00:11:35.892 --> 00:11:37.925
people end up
being Australian.

182
00:11:37.927 --> 00:11:40.360
Ah. People do sometimes end up
being Australian.

183
00:11:40.362 --> 00:11:42.562
Shut up!

184
00:11:42.564 --> 00:11:44.899
Oh, God! I don't
actually mean "shut up."

185
00:11:44.901 --> 00:11:46.566
It's a figure of speech.

186
00:11:46.568 --> 00:11:48.502
I don't know
if you do that in England.

187
00:11:48.504 --> 00:11:50.504
What? Figures of speech?

188
00:11:50.506 --> 00:11:51.574
- Yeah.
- Yeah. We invented that.

189
00:11:53.375 --> 00:11:54.410
Right.

190
00:11:57.881 --> 00:11:59.514
You know, some...

191
00:11:59.516 --> 00:12:01.883
Some might say that I'm not
exercising good judgment

192
00:12:01.885 --> 00:12:03.751
following a strange man
somewhere.

193
00:12:03.753 --> 00:12:05.453
This is how
people get shoved

194
00:12:05.455 --> 00:12:06.756
in the back
of sketchy vans, right?

195
00:12:08.692 --> 00:12:10.024
That makes this
rather awkward.

196
00:12:10.026 --> 00:12:11.360
Mmm.

197
00:12:11.995 --> 00:12:13.195
Get in the van.

198
00:12:13.763 --> 00:12:14.864
What?

199
00:12:19.268 --> 00:12:21.803
Oh, my God! Okay, what is happening?

200
00:12:21.805 --> 00:12:23.838
Did I do something wrong?
Am I in trouble?

201
00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.774
Listen, we just wanna talk
about Drew Thayer.

202
00:12:26.776 --> 00:12:28.643
- He's your boyfriend, right?
- No.

203
00:12:28.645 --> 00:12:31.412
I mean, yes. Well, he was my
boyfriend, but we broke up.

204
00:12:31.414 --> 00:12:32.613
Why? Is he in trouble?

205
00:12:32.615 --> 00:12:34.449
Yes. Drew is
in a lot of trouble.

206
00:12:34.451 --> 00:12:35.817
That's why you're in a van.

207
00:12:35.819 --> 00:12:36.984
Do you know where

208
00:12:36.986 --> 00:12:38.986
your ex-boyfriend worked,
Miss Stockman?

209
00:12:38.988 --> 00:12:40.621
Uh, yeah. NPR.

210
00:12:40.623 --> 00:12:42.890
He had a podcast.
It was about, um...

211
00:12:42.892 --> 00:12:45.359
I'm not 100% sure
what it was about,

212
00:12:45.361 --> 00:12:48.863
but like jazz and economics.

213
00:12:48.865 --> 00:12:50.665
Okay, nobody
listened to that podcast.

214
00:12:50.667 --> 00:12:52.400
Not even me,
and I went to Harvard.

215
00:12:52.402 --> 00:12:53.735
Wow. Only took you
two minutes.

216
00:12:53.737 --> 00:12:56.671
Well, I had to give her that
for context, Seb.

217
00:12:56.673 --> 00:12:58.806
That podcast
was Drew's cover job.

218
00:12:58.808 --> 00:13:01.011
Well, Drew never mentioned
having another job.

219
00:13:01.911 --> 00:13:04.247
Listen, Drew was CIA.

220
00:13:05.615 --> 00:13:06.616
I'm sorry. What?

221
00:13:13.858 --> 00:13:14.657
Oh, my God!

222
00:13:16.626 --> 00:13:18.493
You were in Vegas
when we saw Celine Dion?

223
00:13:18.495 --> 00:13:19.862
Ironically.

224
00:13:19.864 --> 00:13:23.631
- Oh, my God!
- Listen, Drew's gone missing.

225
00:13:23.633 --> 00:13:25.801
A lot of innocent people are
gonna die unless we find him.

226
00:13:25.803 --> 00:13:27.437
Has he been in contact
with you?

227
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.639
No.

228
00:13:31.641 --> 00:13:33.309
- Are you sure?
- Mmm-mmm. No.

229
00:13:34.779 --> 00:13:36.645
Oh, unless it was
last Tuesday night,

230
00:13:36.647 --> 00:13:37.612
'cause I dropped
my phone in the tub

231
00:13:37.614 --> 00:13:38.479
and it stopped working
for a little while.

232
00:13:38.481 --> 00:13:40.481
That's... Yep,
that's what happened.

233
00:13:40.483 --> 00:13:41.850
So I went on the Internet,

234
00:13:41.852 --> 00:13:43.118
and I was like,
"How do I fix my phone?"

235
00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.820
It said to put it
in a bag of rice,

236
00:13:44.822 --> 00:13:46.622
so I was like,
"I don't have rice."

237
00:13:46.624 --> 00:13:48.324
Okay. You do not
wanna lie to us.

238
00:13:51.695 --> 00:13:54.696
Okay. Okay, fine.
Yes, he called me last night.

239
00:13:54.698 --> 00:13:56.832
Well, I guess he called me back.
Finally.

240
00:13:56.834 --> 00:13:58.867
I called him, like,
a thousand times.

241
00:13:58.869 --> 00:14:01.036
Just this week, after I
stopped hearing from him.

242
00:14:01.038 --> 00:14:03.808
I called him, like, a normal
amount when we were together.

243
00:14:04.008 --> 00:14:05.009
I'm normal.

244
00:14:06.644 --> 00:14:07.645
Okay.

245
00:14:11.782 --> 00:14:12.714
Oh, my God.
I love you, Mom.

246
00:14:12.716 --> 00:14:14.917
Morgan.
Morgan, I need to talk to you.

247
00:14:14.919 --> 00:14:16.752
Oh, wait.
Audrey just got home.

248
00:14:16.754 --> 00:14:18.854
- I need to talk to you.
- I need to talk to you.

249
00:14:18.856 --> 00:14:20.589
Viktor is in my room
right now.

250
00:14:20.591 --> 00:14:21.523
I don't know
who the fuck that is.

251
00:14:21.525 --> 00:14:23.659
Viktor, the guy from the bar
last night.

252
00:14:23.661 --> 00:14:24.660
Turns out
I left my driver's license.

253
00:14:24.662 --> 00:14:26.528
He sent me a Facebook message.

254
00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:27.896
And then he sent me
two pictures of his dick.

255
00:14:27.898 --> 00:14:28.997
- Okay. I don't...
- I don't really... I know,

256
00:14:28.999 --> 00:14:30.766
I don't wanna reward
that kind of behavior either,

257
00:14:30.768 --> 00:14:31.767
but I needed
my driver's license back.

258
00:14:31.769 --> 00:14:34.469
I'm not gonna go to the DMV.
I mean, kill me.

259
00:14:34.471 --> 00:14:36.105
Totally. Can we just... I just
need to tell you something.

260
00:14:36.107 --> 00:14:39.408
But I'm using this opportunity
to teach him about feminism.

261
00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:40.876
There he is. Hey.

262
00:14:40.878 --> 00:14:42.644
You remember Audrey
from last night?

263
00:14:42.646 --> 00:14:45.081
Yeah. You know, Audrey,

264
00:14:45.083 --> 00:14:47.685
"There is no limit to what
we women can achieve."

265
00:14:48.652 --> 00:14:49.687
Michelle Obama.

266
00:14:51.856 --> 00:14:53.589
Okay. I take shower.

267
00:14:53.591 --> 00:14:54.592
Okay.

268
00:14:55.693 --> 00:14:57.626
He's doing very well.
One second.

269
00:14:57.628 --> 00:14:59.963
Mom, did you get the dick pics
that I forwarded you?

270
00:14:59.965 --> 00:15:01.130
- Morgan.
- What?

271
00:15:01.132 --> 00:15:02.598
Audrey thinks it's weird
that we tell

272
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.665
each other everything.
I think it's...

273
00:15:03.667 --> 00:15:05.467
I know.
Of course, it's normal.

274
00:15:05.469 --> 00:15:06.870
Yes! That's what I said.

275
00:15:06.872 --> 00:15:08.972
It looks like an unbaked
crescent roll.

276
00:15:08.974 --> 00:15:10.572
No, I know you like them uncut.

277
00:15:10.574 --> 00:15:12.441
Wait, hold on. My mom wants
to know if you've ever been

278
00:15:12.443 --> 00:15:13.542
- with an uncircumcised guy?
- Oh, my God.

279
00:15:13.544 --> 00:15:15.111
Morgan, I'm begging you.
Get off the fucking phone!

280
00:15:15.113 --> 00:15:16.848
Okay, I love you.
I'll talk to you later.

281
00:15:17.983 --> 00:15:18.850
What?

282
00:15:20.451 --> 00:15:23.922
Get this. Two guys show up
at my work from the CIA.

283
00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.057
They wanna talk about Drew.

284
00:15:27.524 --> 00:15:28.727
They said he's a spy.

285
00:15:31.796 --> 00:15:32.964
What do you mean, a spy?

286
00:15:34.633 --> 00:15:36.566
Morgan, I'm serious.

287
00:15:36.568 --> 00:15:38.134
They showed me photos of him

288
00:15:38.136 --> 00:15:41.170
with, like, dead bodies
and, like, weapons and blood.

289
00:15:41.172 --> 00:15:43.006
Wait, wait. What? What?
I know.

290
00:15:43.008 --> 00:15:45.108
I know this sounds batshit crazy,
but just think about it, okay?

291
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.577
There were so many unanswered
questions about that guy.

292
00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:48.912
Like if he went to Vassar,

293
00:15:48.914 --> 00:15:50.647
why does he pronounce it
"liberry"?

294
00:15:50.649 --> 00:15:52.617
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

295
00:15:56.087 --> 00:15:58.855
Sorry.

296
00:15:58.857 --> 00:16:00.725
Couldn't remember
if you were 3-A or 3-B.

297
00:16:01.526 --> 00:16:03.126
- Hey.
- What?

298
00:16:03.128 --> 00:16:05.261
I'm not great on text.
I'm better on email.

299
00:16:05.263 --> 00:16:06.498
You know that. I'm...

300
00:16:08.199 --> 00:16:09.933
Why does it smell like
lighter fluid?

301
00:16:09.935 --> 00:16:11.100
Because I wasn't kidding
when I told you

302
00:16:11.102 --> 00:16:12.802
I was gonna
set your shit on fire.

303
00:16:12.804 --> 00:16:14.271
Look, listen, I get it.

304
00:16:14.273 --> 00:16:15.205
It's a long story.

305
00:16:15.207 --> 00:16:16.839
There was something
that I had to deal with.

306
00:16:16.841 --> 00:16:18.677
Okay? I just wasn't
in the right headspace.

307
00:16:19.945 --> 00:16:20.779
I know you're a spy.

308
00:16:22.981 --> 00:16:24.714
Yeah.

309
00:16:24.716 --> 00:16:26.516
These guys
showed up at my work,

310
00:16:26.518 --> 00:16:28.285
shoved me into a van,

311
00:16:28.287 --> 00:16:29.955
and showed me
these horrible photos.

312
00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:32.655
Where...

313
00:16:32.657 --> 00:16:33.723
- What did you tell 'em?
- What do you mean,

314
00:16:33.725 --> 00:16:34.891
"What did I tell them?"
You're not gonna deny to it?

315
00:16:34.893 --> 00:16:38.128
Or tell me those photos
were photoshopped or anything?

316
00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.530
Oh, my God!
You have a fucking gun!

317
00:16:40.532 --> 00:16:42.532
I need you to tell me
exactly what you told them.

318
00:16:42.534 --> 00:16:44.003
Wait, is this why
you broke up with me?

319
00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:48.005
- What's on your forehead?
- What?

320
00:16:48.007 --> 00:16:49.974
You have, like, this little
red dot on your forehead.

321
00:16:49.976 --> 00:16:51.942
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God!

322
00:16:51.944 --> 00:16:52.945
Go, go, go!

323
00:16:53.778 --> 00:16:54.646
Stay down!

324
00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:56.882
Go! Go!

325
00:16:57.316 --> 00:16:58.715
Stay down!

326
00:16:58.717 --> 00:17:00.117
Stay away from the windows!

327
00:17:00.119 --> 00:17:01.519
Dad, I have to call you back.

328
00:17:05.891 --> 00:17:07.026
What the fuck
is going on?

329
00:17:07.326 --> 00:17:08.560
Morgan!

330
00:17:09.627 --> 00:17:10.730
Wait, you're bleeding.

331
00:17:11.563 --> 00:17:12.730
Fuck!

332
00:17:12.732 --> 00:17:14.164
Some bad people are after me.

333
00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:15.299
The CIA?

334
00:17:15.301 --> 00:17:18.268
And some other people too.
And now they're after you.

335
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.570
- It's exactly why I left you.
- Oh, my God.

336
00:17:20.572 --> 00:17:21.807
I didn't want you in danger.

337
00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:26.910
It's also why I left you this.

338
00:17:26.912 --> 00:17:28.180
- Your trophy?
- Because I trust you.

339
00:17:29.815 --> 00:17:32.216
A lot of innocent people
are gonna die

340
00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:34.818
unless we get this
to where it needs to go, okay?

341
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.854
So what we're gonna do is, we're
gonna leave the apartment.

342
00:17:36.856 --> 00:17:39.189
We're gonna go
to Vienna. Okay?

343
00:17:39.191 --> 00:17:40.893
And we're gonna go
to Cafe Schiele.

344
00:17:42.094 --> 00:17:44.028
We're gonna meet
someone named Verne

345
00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:45.829
at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

346
00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:46.930
Wait. Why are you
telling me this

347
00:17:46.932 --> 00:17:48.632
if we're doing this together?

348
00:17:48.634 --> 00:17:51.135
In case I don't make it
outta here alive.

349
00:17:51.137 --> 00:17:53.639
- No, Drew, you're not gonna die.
- Listen to me.

350
00:17:54.774 --> 00:17:58.842
11:00 a.m.
Cafe Schiele. Verne.

351
00:17:58.844 --> 00:18:00.744
- You got it?
- Okay, got it.

352
00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:02.715
And don't trust anybody.

353
00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:05.115
Anybody.

354
00:18:09.622 --> 00:18:10.723
<i>Do svidanya,</i> Drew.

355
00:18:11.891 --> 00:18:12.925
Oh, my God!

356
00:18:20.966 --> 00:18:22.699
Oh, my God! Drew's dead.

357
00:18:22.701 --> 00:18:23.303
Open up!

358
00:18:24.637 --> 00:18:26.804
Fire escape!
Fire escape.

359
00:18:26.806 --> 00:18:28.239
Open up now!
We got a search warrant!

360
00:18:32.345 --> 00:18:33.744
Hallway clear!

361
00:18:33.746 --> 00:18:34.747
Door right.

362
00:18:35.215 --> 00:18:36.314
Clear!

363
00:18:36.316 --> 00:18:37.650
Check it!

364
00:18:43.656 --> 00:18:44.690
- Are you okay?
- What?

365
00:18:45.392 --> 00:18:47.060
No! Are you?

366
00:18:48.694 --> 00:18:49.963
- No.
- Okay.

367
00:18:51.298 --> 00:18:53.164
So, um,
where are we going?

368
00:18:53.166 --> 00:18:55.400
I don't know.
Where are we gonna be safe?

369
00:18:55.402 --> 00:18:56.968
Pull into that parking lot.

370
00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:57.969
There's a bathroom
in that Pilates Plus.

371
00:18:57.971 --> 00:19:01.072
We are not hiding
in a fucking Pilates Plus.

372
00:19:01.074 --> 00:19:02.440
Where's the police station?

373
00:19:02.442 --> 00:19:03.975
What? No, police.

374
00:19:03.977 --> 00:19:06.311
We're not doing police
'cause I killed someone.

375
00:19:06.313 --> 00:19:07.879
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

376
00:19:07.881 --> 00:19:09.080
Call the CIA guys.

377
00:19:09.082 --> 00:19:11.082
No! Drew said
that we can't trust anyone,

378
00:19:11.084 --> 00:19:13.351
and he's right,
'cause he's dead!

379
00:19:13.353 --> 00:19:15.286
Probably because
I talked to them.

380
00:19:15.288 --> 00:19:16.955
No, it's 'cause
I let the assassin

381
00:19:16.957 --> 00:19:18.923
into the apartment.

382
00:19:18.925 --> 00:19:20.725
Okay, fair enough.
It's both our faults.

383
00:19:23.063 --> 00:19:24.865
- Shit!
- You gonna get the call?

384
00:19:25.198 --> 00:19:26.097
Hello.

385
00:19:26.099 --> 00:19:27.300
<i>Audrey, it's Sebastian.</i>

386
00:19:27.901 --> 00:19:29.367
You killed Drew.

387
00:19:29.369 --> 00:19:31.035
I told you
where he was gonna be,

388
00:19:31.037 --> 00:19:32.270
and you fucking killed him!

389
00:19:32.272 --> 00:19:33.838
Sorry, can I ask a question?
Who is this?

390
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.273
That's the asshole
from the CIA.

391
00:19:35.275 --> 00:19:36.875
<i>Audrey,
where are you taking it?</i>

392
00:19:36.877 --> 00:19:37.976
Why would I tell you?

393
00:19:37.978 --> 00:19:39.179
<i>Give us the package.</i>

394
00:19:39.746 --> 00:19:40.912
<i>Trust me.</i>

395
00:19:40.914 --> 00:19:42.249
I don't trust anyone anymore.

396
00:19:44.885 --> 00:19:46.718
You trust me though, right?

397
00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.920
Yes, of course, I trust you.
You don't count.

398
00:19:48.922 --> 00:19:51.122
Good. 'Cause this is not
some fake spy friendship

399
00:19:51.124 --> 00:19:52.857
that the Russians
put together.

400
00:19:52.859 --> 00:19:54.326
Dude, shut up. I know.

401
00:19:54.328 --> 00:19:56.127
Okay, Drew said that if
we don't deliver this package,

402
00:19:56.129 --> 00:19:57.896
a lot of people are gonna die.

403
00:19:57.898 --> 00:19:58.930
What if we don't do it
and then there's

404
00:19:58.932 --> 00:20:00.732
a terrorist attack
or something?

405
00:20:00.734 --> 00:20:02.201
Well, what did he say to do?

406
00:20:02.203 --> 00:20:04.137
We have to get it
to a cafe in Vienna.

407
00:20:05.339 --> 00:20:06.671
Austria, Vienna?

408
00:20:06.673 --> 00:20:08.909
- Yes. That's what he said.
- Okay. Well, why don't we do that then?

409
00:20:10.244 --> 00:20:11.876
Do what? Go to Europe

410
00:20:11.878 --> 00:20:13.379
when a bunch of people
are trying to kill us?

411
00:20:13.381 --> 00:20:16.081
Do you wanna die
having never been to Europe?

412
00:20:16.083 --> 00:20:18.685
Or do you wanna go to Europe
and die having been to Europe?

413
00:20:19.487 --> 00:20:21.721
Why are those
my only two options?

414
00:20:23.157 --> 00:20:24.889
Okay. This is a sign.

415
00:20:24.891 --> 00:20:26.325
Our passports
are still in there

416
00:20:26.327 --> 00:20:27.861
from our road trip to Tijuana.

417
00:20:29.763 --> 00:20:31.530
Okay, someone that you love

418
00:20:31.532 --> 00:20:34.202
just died and asked you
to do one last thing.

419
00:20:35.169 --> 00:20:36.437
I think you gotta do it.

420
00:20:37.271 --> 00:20:38.206
I'll go with you.

421
00:20:40.408 --> 00:20:42.875
Okay, fuck it. Let's just...
Let's go to Austria.

422
00:20:42.877 --> 00:20:43.911
Let's go to Austria.

423
00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.513
- Why are you turning?
- I have to park.

424
00:20:47.515 --> 00:20:48.781
People are trying to kill us.

425
00:20:48.783 --> 00:20:49.817
We're not fucking
parking in Lot C.

426
00:20:56.857 --> 00:20:58.290
<i>We need a suitcase.</i>

427
00:20:58.292 --> 00:21:00.292
I think it looks suspicious if we
go through international security

428
00:21:00.294 --> 00:21:02.261
with no luggage and just
a weird trophy, right?

429
00:21:02.263 --> 00:21:04.196
Wait. Wouldn't it be
more suspicious

430
00:21:04.198 --> 00:21:05.798
if we go through security
with a suitcase

431
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.967
that's totally empty
except for the weird trophy?

432
00:21:07.969 --> 00:21:10.002
Yes. We need
more trophies then.

433
00:21:10.004 --> 00:21:11.403
That's what we'll do.

434
00:21:11.405 --> 00:21:13.305
We'll be the kind of women
who jet off to Vienna

435
00:21:13.307 --> 00:21:14.541
with all of our awards.

436
00:21:14.543 --> 00:21:16.108
We're notable.
We're recognized.

437
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:17.411
We have trophies, baby!

438
00:21:18.379 --> 00:21:19.481
"Best Grandson"?

439
00:21:20.314 --> 00:21:21.548
Yes.

440
00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:22.582
Don't be nervous.

441
00:21:22.584 --> 00:21:25.317
People get caught
when they're not confident.

442
00:21:25.319 --> 00:21:28.155
Hello, are you new?
I usually deal with Cesar.

443
00:21:30.024 --> 00:21:31.323
Shit! We gotta
get rid of our phones.

444
00:21:31.325 --> 00:21:33.225
Bad guys can track us
even if they're off.

445
00:21:33.227 --> 00:21:35.462
Oh, right. I've actually
known that for a long time.

446
00:21:35.464 --> 00:21:37.263
I went to performing arts camp
with Edward Snowden.

447
00:21:37.265 --> 00:21:38.598
Oh, that's right.
You used to date Snowden.

448
00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.000
No, no. He tried.

449
00:21:41.002 --> 00:21:42.103
God, he was obsessed with me.

450
00:21:43.004 --> 00:21:44.937
He was really into ska.

451
00:21:44.939 --> 00:21:46.171
When the whole thing
was going down, I was like,

452
00:21:46.173 --> 00:21:47.106
"Why is no one
talking about the fact

453
00:21:47.108 --> 00:21:49.309
"that Edward Snowden
is really into ska?"

454
00:21:49.311 --> 00:21:50.778
- Give me your phone.
- Oh, yeah.

455
00:21:52.547 --> 00:21:55.848
<i>Final call
for boarding Flight 232.</i>

456
00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:57.284
<i>Final call
for boarding Flight 232.</i>

457
00:21:57.286 --> 00:21:58.351
Bitch!

458
00:21:58.353 --> 00:21:59.488
Oh.

459
00:22:00.322 --> 00:22:02.056
Bitch!

460
00:22:11.133 --> 00:22:12.867
- <i>Mambo No. 5?</i>
- Oh, please.

461
00:22:14.102 --> 00:22:14.967
- What?
- Have you heard mambos

462
00:22:14.969 --> 00:22:16.202
one through four?
They're fantastic.

463
00:22:16.204 --> 00:22:17.370
- Wow!
- Yeah.

464
00:22:17.372 --> 00:22:19.005
That's good.
That's good.

465
00:22:19.007 --> 00:22:20.242
Oh, I got one.
Close your eyes.

466
00:22:21.376 --> 00:22:22.311
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

467
00:22:33.889 --> 00:22:35.223
Oh. Um...

468
00:22:36.091 --> 00:22:37.326
No. Uh...

471
00:22:51.573 --> 00:22:53.073
Yeah, that's the worst song.

472
00:22:53.075 --> 00:22:54.207
- You win.
- Right?

473
00:22:54.209 --> 00:22:55.375
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

474
00:22:55.377 --> 00:22:56.443
- That's the worst.
- Thank you.

475
00:22:56.445 --> 00:22:58.545
They play this kind of stuff
in Europe all the time.

476
00:22:58.547 --> 00:23:00.246
It's like the whole
continent just said,

477
00:23:00.248 --> 00:23:02.351
"You know what? I love 1994.
Let's just stay here."

478
00:23:04.353 --> 00:23:06.221
I wouldn't know.
I've never been to Europe.

479
00:23:24.407 --> 00:23:25.541
Oh!

480
00:23:26.975 --> 00:23:28.342
For our special today,

481
00:23:28.344 --> 00:23:30.977
I would recommend
our meat and bread platter

482
00:23:30.979 --> 00:23:32.546
with a hot pot of fondue.

483
00:23:32.548 --> 00:23:34.249
This is really fancy.

484
00:23:34.684 --> 00:23:35.884
We belong here.

485
00:23:37.387 --> 00:23:40.086
Was this a place that Drew
would hang out at?

486
00:23:40.088 --> 00:23:41.722
I mean, Drew. Like...

487
00:23:41.724 --> 00:23:46.094
The same guy that called
7-Eleven sushi Japanese food.

488
00:23:47.296 --> 00:23:48.598
Okay. Who do we
think Verne is?

489
00:23:49.699 --> 00:23:51.232
I don't know.

490
00:23:51.234 --> 00:23:53.001
And won't Verne
be looking for Drew?

491
00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:56.406
- Fuck!
- How's he gonna know it's us?

492
00:23:57.106 --> 00:23:58.639
God damn it!
What do we do?

493
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:03.346
Oh, no. What's wrong?
What do you see?

494
00:24:05.715 --> 00:24:08.716
Oh, nothing.
It's just that, um,

495
00:24:08.718 --> 00:24:10.919
cake's a lot of flour
and dairy for me. I...

496
00:24:12.121 --> 00:24:14.355
I have to have diarrhea.

497
00:24:14.357 --> 00:24:15.525
- Okay.
- Okay.

498
00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.494
Morgan, you should...
You should probably go.

499
00:24:20.496 --> 00:24:22.196
- I can hold it.
- No.

500
00:24:22.198 --> 00:24:24.398
- No. Mmm. You should probably not do that.
- No.

501
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.332
No.
No, this is more important.

502
00:24:25.334 --> 00:24:27.537
No! Oh, my gosh.
It's really not. Please go.

503
00:24:35.678 --> 00:24:37.211
Can I bring you anything else?

504
00:24:37.213 --> 00:24:39.180
Uh, no.

505
00:24:39.182 --> 00:24:41.348
Don't make a noise.

506
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:43.019
I'm the person
you're here to meet.

507
00:24:45.288 --> 00:24:47.521
I'm sorry.
Um, you're Verne?

508
00:24:47.523 --> 00:24:49.791
It's an alias.
Now, hand the package over.

509
00:24:49.793 --> 00:24:51.595
Wait. None of this
is making any sense.

510
00:24:53.529 --> 00:24:55.131
- Oh, my God!
- Don't say a word.

511
00:24:56.299 --> 00:24:57.465
Okay.

512
00:24:57.467 --> 00:24:59.300
Oh, my God.

513
00:25:02.473 --> 00:25:04.071
I'm trying to protect you.

514
00:25:04.073 --> 00:25:05.807
Yeah. The same way
you protected Drew?

515
00:25:05.809 --> 00:25:07.341
If you were here
to protect me,

516
00:25:07.343 --> 00:25:08.375
you wouldn't be
pointing a gun at me.

517
00:25:08.377 --> 00:25:10.779
I may not be in the CIA,
but I know that much.

518
00:25:10.781 --> 00:25:13.080
MI6, actually.
Drew was CIA.

519
00:25:13.082 --> 00:25:14.416
It's an international effort.

520
00:25:14.418 --> 00:25:15.684
Whatever!

521
00:25:26.663 --> 00:25:28.162
You're Verne?

522
00:25:28.164 --> 00:25:29.165
<i>Guten Morgen.</i>

523
00:25:32.068 --> 00:25:33.237
<i>Guten</i> Verne.

524
00:25:35.171 --> 00:25:36.204
Would you please stop
pointing that?

525
00:25:36.206 --> 00:25:37.539
It's making me very nervous.

526
00:25:37.541 --> 00:25:38.607
- When I get nervous...
- Sit still and listen.

527
00:25:38.609 --> 00:25:40.709
Okay.

528
00:25:40.711 --> 00:25:43.378
In a moment, everyone in this
cafe is gonna start shooting.

529
00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.213
They all want
what you've got,

530
00:25:45.215 --> 00:25:46.414
and they'll kill
each and every one of us

531
00:25:46.416 --> 00:25:47.451
until they get it.

532
00:25:50.354 --> 00:25:52.287
If you run,
you'll be killed.

533
00:25:52.289 --> 00:25:53.455
If you do manage to get out,

534
00:25:53.457 --> 00:25:54.422
you won't be able
to go anywhere.

535
00:25:54.424 --> 00:25:55.490
If you scan your passport
at the border,

536
00:25:55.492 --> 00:25:57.592
there will be men with guns
bigger than this one

537
00:25:57.594 --> 00:25:59.294
that won't say a word
before they kill you.

538
00:25:59.296 --> 00:26:01.229
And if you do make it
to the airport,

539
00:26:01.231 --> 00:26:03.298
we'll be waiting for you.

540
00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:06.368
So hand the package over,
and no one gets hurt.

541
00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:07.502
Except for Drew.

542
00:26:07.504 --> 00:26:09.706
Okay. It's not productive
to keep bringing that up.

543
00:26:11.542 --> 00:26:15.078
That's not Verne.

544
00:26:17.114 --> 00:26:18.115
The package.

545
00:26:19.851 --> 00:26:21.051
Good.

546
00:26:34.131 --> 00:26:35.667
That's not Verne!

547
00:26:40.504 --> 00:26:41.505
What?

548
00:26:52.617 --> 00:26:53.417
What?

549
00:27:01.926 --> 00:27:03.293
Oh, my God!

550
00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:16.741
Morgan!

551
00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:40.531
Oh, my God.

552
00:27:54.846 --> 00:27:55.914
No!

553
00:27:56.848 --> 00:27:57.649
No! Verne, wait!

554
00:28:02.921 --> 00:28:03.987
Holy shit! Run!

555
00:28:28.379 --> 00:28:30.614
Oh, my God! I killed someone!
I killed someone!

556
00:28:30.616 --> 00:28:32.483
- Stop yelling that!
- Oh, my God!

557
00:28:34.019 --> 00:28:36.252
- Oh, my God!
- Wait. Shit.

558
00:28:36.254 --> 00:28:37.554
Get in the fucking car!
Get in the car!

559
00:28:37.556 --> 00:28:38.889
That car?
That's not our car!

560
00:28:38.891 --> 00:28:39.823
Sorry! I'm so sorry!
I'm sorry.

561
00:28:39.825 --> 00:28:41.357
Hey! Ah!

562
00:28:41.359 --> 00:28:42.559
Okay!
Okay, we're set.

563
00:28:42.561 --> 00:28:43.627
- Oh, shit!
- What?

564
00:28:43.629 --> 00:28:46.429
It's a stick. Do you know
how to drive a stick?

565
00:28:46.431 --> 00:28:49.298
- No! No!
- Fuck!

566
00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:51.735
- Which one's the brake?
- I don't know. There are so many.

567
00:28:51.737 --> 00:28:52.969
How do I change
the fucking gear?

568
00:28:52.971 --> 00:28:54.004
How does your car work?

569
00:28:54.006 --> 00:28:55.539
I'm so sorry.

570
00:28:55.541 --> 00:28:56.907
- It's an emergency!
- Oh, my God!

571
00:28:56.909 --> 00:28:57.743
- Oh, God!
- Oh!

572
00:29:03.582 --> 00:29:06.316
- Okay. It wasn't so bad.
- Get out! Abort! Mission abort!

573
00:29:06.318 --> 00:29:08.385
Sorry! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

574
00:29:08.387 --> 00:29:09.655
Hurry! Hurry!

575
00:29:10.289 --> 00:29:11.423
Hey!

576
00:29:12.991 --> 00:29:15.527
Stop. The cab. Come on.

577
00:29:17.429 --> 00:29:19.398
Hello. Hi, can we go, please?

578
00:29:21.433 --> 00:29:22.666
- Mr. Yang?
- Yeah.

579
00:29:22.668 --> 00:29:24.434
Yeah, my mother
married a Chinese man.

580
00:29:24.436 --> 00:29:25.969
It's a very long,
beautiful story. They met...

581
00:29:25.971 --> 00:29:28.572
We are Yang.
We are Mr. Yang. Yes.

582
00:29:28.574 --> 00:29:29.573
- All right.
- Thank you so much.

583
00:29:29.575 --> 00:29:31.007
Thank you.
We gotta go.

584
00:29:31.009 --> 00:29:31.844
And we're on the gas.

585
00:29:34.313 --> 00:29:36.446
- So, you guys visiting?
- No, we live here.

586
00:29:36.448 --> 00:29:38.584
I'm an Austrian man
named Mr. Yang. Go.

587
00:29:39.651 --> 00:29:40.751
So, I'm Lukas.

588
00:29:40.753 --> 00:29:41.986
How can I make your ride

589
00:29:41.988 --> 00:29:44.488
- in Vienna excellent today?
- Everything's fine.

590
00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:45.422
Everything's great.
Can you just drive?

591
00:29:45.424 --> 00:29:47.357
Oh, no. Fine is not
good enough for me.

592
00:29:47.359 --> 00:29:48.625
- Okay.
- I want excellent.

593
00:29:48.627 --> 00:29:50.627
Would you like some waters?
Still? Sparkling?

594
00:29:50.629 --> 00:29:51.996
No, water. Fully hydrated.

595
00:29:51.998 --> 00:29:52.964
Would you like
to listen to music?

596
00:29:52.966 --> 00:29:55.365
No. No, no. No music.
Just drive, please.

597
00:29:55.367 --> 00:29:56.968
But I'm not only
a driver, actually.

598
00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:58.735
I'm also a DJ
on Saturday nights.

599
00:29:58.737 --> 00:30:00.771
Oh, get out!
Wow, that's cool.

600
00:30:00.773 --> 00:30:01.839
I don't know
if you guys are still in town

601
00:30:01.841 --> 00:30:02.809
on Saturday, but look.

602
00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:05.843
Hip-hop music.

603
00:30:05.845 --> 00:30:07.646
Jump. Jump.
Jump. Jump.

604
00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:09.949
Huh? Good, huh?

605
00:30:21.661 --> 00:30:22.994
- Shit!
- Oh, my God!

606
00:30:22.996 --> 00:30:23.995
Okay, listen, buddy.

607
00:30:23.997 --> 00:30:25.596
There's a bunch of men
chasing us with guns,

608
00:30:25.598 --> 00:30:27.634
and I need you
to lose them now.

609
00:30:29.068 --> 00:30:30.367
Fuck yeah!

610
00:30:31.503 --> 00:30:32.505
Oh, my God!

611
00:30:35.074 --> 00:30:36.509
Whoo-hoo!

612
00:30:39.012 --> 00:30:40.312
They're men. Oh, my God!

613
00:30:42.148 --> 00:30:43.714
Oh, my God!

614
00:30:59.999 --> 00:31:02.066
I smoked so much meth before.

615
00:31:02.068 --> 00:31:03.534
Great! Great!

616
00:31:10.677 --> 00:31:11.911
Fear is an illusion!

617
00:31:22.956 --> 00:31:24.023
High five. Up here.

618
00:31:28.695 --> 00:31:29.696
Oh, fuck!

619
00:31:34.767 --> 00:31:36.201
- Get on top of him.
- Okay.

620
00:31:36.203 --> 00:31:37.501
Oh, my God!

621
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:45.511
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

622
00:31:52.219 --> 00:31:53.218
Oh, my God.
There's one left.

623
00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:54.754
I know. I see him.

624
00:31:56.723 --> 00:31:57.756
Okay, why are you using
the turn signal?

625
00:31:57.758 --> 00:31:59.124
You're literally telling him
where we're going.

626
00:31:59.126 --> 00:32:00.591
Sorry. It's a force of habit.

627
00:32:00.593 --> 00:32:01.692
It's a bad habit.

628
00:32:01.694 --> 00:32:02.660
No! It's a good habit.

629
00:32:02.662 --> 00:32:04.965
In most circumstances,
it is a very good habit!

630
00:32:09.169 --> 00:32:11.169
Oh, my God!

631
00:32:11.171 --> 00:32:12.405
Fuck you!

632
00:32:17.811 --> 00:32:18.812
Eat my shit!

633
00:32:20.681 --> 00:32:21.947
- Oh, my God!
- Okay.

634
00:32:21.949 --> 00:32:23.050
Get in the front.

635
00:32:23.784 --> 00:32:25.117
Yep. Yeah.

636
00:32:25.119 --> 00:32:26.120
Oh, no!

637
00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:35.794
- I can't get my seat belt on!
- Where the fuck is he?

638
00:32:35.796 --> 00:32:36.929
Oh, my God!

639
00:32:38.732 --> 00:32:40.134
He's on the fucking roof!

640
00:32:44.071 --> 00:32:45.806
Oh, no! It's the man! Stop it!

641
00:32:49.009 --> 00:32:50.511
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

642
00:32:53.681 --> 00:32:54.949
He's on the top!
He's on the top!

643
00:32:56.684 --> 00:32:58.150
No!

644
00:32:58.152 --> 00:32:59.653
Okay. There she goes.

645
00:33:14.835 --> 00:33:16.570
- Why are you speeding up?
- I got a plan!

646
00:33:17.038 --> 00:33:18.770
- Okay!
- Hold on!

647
00:33:26.147 --> 00:33:27.713
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

648
00:33:35.957 --> 00:33:37.556
- Get the fuck out!
- Okay!

649
00:33:37.558 --> 00:33:38.826
Great job! Five stars, Lukas!

650
00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.161
Five stars!

651
00:33:41.162 --> 00:33:42.897
Oh, my God!

652
00:33:44.866 --> 00:33:48.067
Oh, God! Jesus!
What happened?

653
00:33:48.069 --> 00:33:48.870
We gotta go.

654
00:33:50.071 --> 00:33:51.740
- We gotta go somewhere.
- Oh, God!

655
00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:53.708
There's a train station.

656
00:34:11.826 --> 00:34:14.093
So you're saying you failed?

657
00:34:14.095 --> 00:34:16.598
<i>No, there were some
unforeseen complications,</i>

658
00:34:17.599 --> 00:34:18.931
but I do have the package.

659
00:34:18.933 --> 00:34:20.101
<i>Let's see it.</i>

660
00:34:28.643 --> 00:34:29.842
It appears I don't have it.

661
00:34:29.844 --> 00:34:31.611
<i>So let me get this right.</i>

662
00:34:31.613 --> 00:34:33.846
You didn't get the package.

663
00:34:33.848 --> 00:34:36.049
The girls still have
the package.

664
00:34:36.051 --> 00:34:38.385
And now Highland is likely
to get the package.

665
00:34:38.387 --> 00:34:39.888
I won't
let that happen, ma'am.

666
00:34:40.789 --> 00:34:42.221
I'm glad that this happened.

667
00:34:42.223 --> 00:34:44.857
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
been awarded Best Grandson.

668
00:34:44.859 --> 00:34:46.061
<i>Okay. That's funny.</i>

669
00:34:48.897 --> 00:34:50.696
Ma'am?
Ma'am, can you hear us?

670
00:34:50.698 --> 00:34:51.764
Ma'am, did you hear us?

671
00:34:51.766 --> 00:34:53.233
- <i>Ma'am, are you frozen?</i>
- <i>Ma'am, can you hear us?</i>

672
00:34:53.235 --> 00:34:54.468
- <i>She's frozen.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

673
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:56.203
<i>Ma'am, wave
if you're not frozen, please.</i>

674
00:34:56.205 --> 00:34:57.637
Not frozen.

675
00:34:57.639 --> 00:35:00.073
<i>Just disappointed.</i>

676
00:35:00.075 --> 00:35:01.741
I was just
trying to protect them.

677
00:35:01.743 --> 00:35:03.009
<i>Protect them?</i>

678
00:35:03.011 --> 00:35:04.710
Yeah, let them die.
They're idiots.

679
00:35:04.712 --> 00:35:06.813
- I know an idiot when I see one.
- In the mirror.

680
00:35:06.815 --> 00:35:08.248
Okay. I'm not an idiot,
Sebastian. For the record...

681
00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:10.250
Here we go. You went to
Harvard. Yes, we all know.

682
00:35:10.252 --> 00:35:11.717
I didn't even mention Harvard.
That's the thing.

683
00:35:11.719 --> 00:35:13.320
<i>He was gonna mention Harvard. I was
making this simply about merit,</i>

684
00:35:13.322 --> 00:35:14.323
<i>and, yeah...</i>

685
00:35:22.697 --> 00:35:24.864
Yes. Get in. Okay, look.

686
00:35:24.866 --> 00:35:26.366
I got us two tickets
to Prague.

687
00:35:26.368 --> 00:35:28.168
- I got us a change of clothes.
- Okay, great. We can change

688
00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:29.669
on the train. It leaves in,
like, 10 minutes.

689
00:35:29.671 --> 00:35:31.004
And then we can fly home
from there.

690
00:35:31.006 --> 00:35:32.873
We just need to get
the fuck out of Vienna.

691
00:35:32.875 --> 00:35:36.110
Wait. Can we just take
a second to appreciate you?

692
00:35:36.112 --> 00:35:38.011
- Now? Right now?
- Yes.

693
00:35:38.013 --> 00:35:40.347
What you did in the cafe
with the gun was insane.

694
00:35:40.349 --> 00:35:41.681
You killed a man.

695
00:35:41.683 --> 00:35:43.250
- It's okay. It was a bad man.
- Oh, my God!

696
00:35:43.252 --> 00:35:45.052
I just play
a lot of video games.

697
00:35:45.054 --> 00:35:46.286
- Can we please just...
- No, and then

698
00:35:46.288 --> 00:35:47.855
what you did with the trophies.
You switched the trophies.

699
00:35:47.857 --> 00:35:49.423
He literally works
in intelligence,

700
00:35:49.425 --> 00:35:50.457
and yet, you were
the more intelligent.

701
00:35:50.459 --> 00:35:51.925
How crazy is that?

702
00:35:51.927 --> 00:35:53.894
And then you did all that
car stuff. Oh, my God!

703
00:35:53.896 --> 00:35:56.263
It all just kinda happened really quickly.
Can we please just move on?

704
00:35:56.265 --> 00:35:59.032
Woman, you are incredible,
and I want you to own it.

705
00:35:59.034 --> 00:36:01.301
Listen, I'm owning it.
Can we just go, please?

706
00:36:01.303 --> 00:36:02.236
- Wait! Wait!
- Oh, my God!

707
00:36:02.238 --> 00:36:04.371
No, I'm not gonna
let you minimize this.

708
00:36:04.373 --> 00:36:05.873
- I'm not minimizing!
- But you always do this.

709
00:36:05.875 --> 00:36:06.974
You always do this.

710
00:36:06.976 --> 00:36:09.009
- Oh, my God!
- Have you ever,

711
00:36:09.011 --> 00:36:10.279
in your whole life,
felt so alive?

712
00:36:12.248 --> 00:36:15.117
<i>Attention, the
train to Prague is now boarding.</i>

713
00:36:16.385 --> 00:36:18.118
We're gonna be
a lot less alive

714
00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.753
if we don't make it out
to the train. Okay? Please.

715
00:36:19.755 --> 00:36:21.188
Wait, wait, wait.
Look at this.

716
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:22.956
They're really playing up
that Mozart is from here,

717
00:36:22.958 --> 00:36:24.324
and they're really downplaying
that Hitler is from here.

718
00:36:24.326 --> 00:36:25.995
- Yeah, I would too. Get out.
- Okay.

719
00:36:28.864 --> 00:36:30.298
What track is it?

720
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:31.901
Um, looks like
track 10 goes to, um...

721
00:36:33.303 --> 00:36:34.935
"Szkalas."

722
00:36:34.937 --> 00:36:37.372
"Szass... Szabadszallas."

723
00:36:37.374 --> 00:36:39.873
"Nove Hodejovice."

724
00:36:39.875 --> 00:36:41.509
"Usti Nad Labem."

725
00:36:41.511 --> 00:36:45.078
"Parndorf ich Bahnhof.
Prague."

726
00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.414
"Prague." Track six.
Oh, thank God.

727
00:36:46.416 --> 00:36:47.981
- Okay, track six.
- Wait. No, no, no, no, no!

728
00:36:47.983 --> 00:36:49.184
Sebastian said
if we use our passports

729
00:36:49.186 --> 00:36:50.351
we'll get stopped at the border.

730
00:36:50.353 --> 00:36:51.352
Shit!

731
00:36:51.354 --> 00:36:52.389
What do we do?

732
00:36:54.957 --> 00:36:57.791
Okay. We just have to find
two girls who look like us,

733
00:36:57.793 --> 00:36:59.327
tell them what happened, and
convince them to give us theirs,

734
00:36:59.329 --> 00:37:01.062
and then they could say
that theirs were stolen.

735
00:37:01.064 --> 00:37:02.796
- Who would do that?
- Any girls.

736
00:37:02.798 --> 00:37:03.931
Any girls would do that.

737
00:37:03.933 --> 00:37:04.733
Okay.

738
00:37:05.968 --> 00:37:07.903
How about them?
They kinda look like us.

739
00:37:10.173 --> 00:37:11.942
No, we don't wanna
be them in Europe.

740
00:37:12.943 --> 00:37:14.976
We wanna be them in Europe.

741
00:37:14.978 --> 00:37:16.344
We go all the way
down there,

742
00:37:16.346 --> 00:37:18.446
and then it ends up
being there.

743
00:37:18.448 --> 00:37:20.781
- Yeah, we do.
- Tight shorts.

744
00:37:20.783 --> 00:37:23.284
Just imagine the only guy
you've ever loved

745
00:37:23.286 --> 00:37:25.053
dying in front of you

746
00:37:25.055 --> 00:37:27.822
and asking you
to do this one thing.

747
00:37:27.824 --> 00:37:30.258
Wouldn't you
sacrifice everything?

748
00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.460
Imagine if that was
your best friend of 12 years.

749
00:37:32.462 --> 00:37:34.128
Wouldn't you go to the ends

750
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:35.830
- of the Earth to protect her?
- Yes.

751
00:37:35.832 --> 00:37:38.399
You guys are weird.

752
00:37:38.401 --> 00:37:40.368
Okay. Actually,
we're not "weed."

753
00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:41.936
We are in danger.

754
00:37:41.938 --> 00:37:43.204
You'd be saving our lives

755
00:37:43.206 --> 00:37:44.372
and the lives
of a lot of innocent people.

756
00:37:44.374 --> 00:37:46.107
Just go to the embassy
and get other passports.

757
00:37:46.109 --> 00:37:48.009
Sorry. We'd love to
help you out, mate,

758
00:37:48.011 --> 00:37:49.277
but we just don't know you.

759
00:37:49.279 --> 00:37:50.979
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

760
00:37:50.981 --> 00:37:52.849
<i>the train to Prague
is now leaving.</i>

761
00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:58.687
You're right. Okay.
You know what?

762
00:37:58.689 --> 00:38:00.388
- Have a great time in Poland.
- It's been beautiful meeting you.

763
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:02.023
Now!

764
00:38:02.025 --> 00:38:03.858
- Go! Get it! Shit!
- Stop it!

765
00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:05.260
No!

766
00:38:05.262 --> 00:38:06.096
- No!
- Stop it!

767
00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:08.798
- I got it!
- Stop! No!

768
00:38:09.433 --> 00:38:11.301
Oi! Give me back my bum bag!

769
00:38:13.937 --> 00:38:15.105
Come on! Get in!

770
00:38:16.006 --> 00:38:17.105
Okay.
Oh, my God!

771
00:38:17.107 --> 00:38:19.073
Close! Oh, my God!
Close.

772
00:38:19.075 --> 00:38:21.042
- Open the door!
- I'm sorry.

773
00:38:21.044 --> 00:38:24.045
Give me back my fucking
bum bag, you bitch!

774
00:38:24.047 --> 00:38:25.514
Look,
your address is on it,

775
00:38:25.516 --> 00:38:28.785
so I can mail it back to you
if we survive.

776
00:38:53.144 --> 00:38:54.178
Hello?

777
00:38:56.013 --> 00:38:57.448
Yes. I understand.

778
00:39:03.521 --> 00:39:06.455
Nadedja.

779
00:39:06.457 --> 00:39:07.990
Nadedja, where are you?

780
00:39:07.992 --> 00:39:10.059
Nadedja, you're going to miss
your cue again.

781
00:39:10.061 --> 00:39:12.227
You always do this.

782
00:39:29.914 --> 00:39:31.580
I feel like
my best friend always knew

783
00:39:31.582 --> 00:39:33.582
that she wanted
to be an actress.

784
00:39:33.584 --> 00:39:36.051
- She's just natural at it.
- Mmm.

785
00:39:36.053 --> 00:39:38.520
I'm not a natural at anything.

786
00:39:38.522 --> 00:39:40.657
- I tried law school.
- Oh, smart.

787
00:39:40.659 --> 00:39:43.359
- Then I tried art school.
- That's good.

788
00:39:43.361 --> 00:39:44.426
Big swing there.

789
00:39:44.428 --> 00:39:45.329
I dropped out of both.

790
00:39:46.531 --> 00:39:48.399
Yeah,
I never finish anything.

791
00:39:52.436 --> 00:39:54.305
Well, hey,
you just finished your beer.

792
00:39:56.107 --> 00:39:57.507
Yeah, that I do finish.

793
00:39:59.511 --> 00:40:02.279
So why don't you finish things?
What are you afraid of?

794
00:40:02.514 --> 00:40:04.081
Mmm.

795
00:40:04.583 --> 00:40:06.416
Being average.

796
00:40:06.418 --> 00:40:09.151
Come on. I would not say
that you are average.

797
00:40:11.356 --> 00:40:13.325
How would you know?
You just met me.

798
00:40:14.992 --> 00:40:16.959
I'm a pretty good judge
of character.

799
00:40:16.961 --> 00:40:18.330
You trust me.

800
00:40:23.134 --> 00:40:24.601
Thank you for the dance.

801
00:40:24.603 --> 00:40:26.269
Would you like me
to get you another beer?

802
00:40:26.271 --> 00:40:28.105
- Yeah! That'd be great.
- Sure.

803
00:40:29.741 --> 00:40:31.608
- Can I get two more, please?
- No problem.

804
00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:32.611
Thank you.

805
00:40:34.546 --> 00:40:37.747
Cool, cool, cool. Okay,
so here's my advice, right?

806
00:40:37.749 --> 00:40:40.216
- Who are you?
- Oh, that's my sister.

807
00:40:40.218 --> 00:40:42.185
- Really?
- Not my biological sister,

808
00:40:42.187 --> 00:40:44.487
but my de facto sister.

809
00:40:44.489 --> 00:40:46.222
- Oh.
- Yeah. She wouldn't want you to know this,

810
00:40:46.224 --> 00:40:48.491
but she lost her virginity
really late,

811
00:40:48.493 --> 00:40:50.293
so she's, like, hungry for it.
You know what I mean?

812
00:40:50.295 --> 00:40:52.095
Oh. Cool.

813
00:40:52.097 --> 00:40:54.030
So have fun with that.

814
00:40:54.032 --> 00:40:57.000
But if you hurt her,

815
00:40:57.002 --> 00:40:59.269
- I'll find your best friend...
- Mmm-hmm.

816
00:40:59.271 --> 00:41:00.405
- ...I'll cut off his dick...
- Mmm-hmm.

817
00:41:01.606 --> 00:41:03.306
...and I'll make you eat it.

818
00:41:03.308 --> 00:41:05.341
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

819
00:41:05.343 --> 00:41:07.177
You can have whatever
condiments you like,

820
00:41:07.179 --> 00:41:08.647
but you gotta finish it.

821
00:41:11.082 --> 00:41:12.348
What's your name?

822
00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:14.684
- Morgan. How you doing?
- Morgan. Drew.

823
00:41:14.686 --> 00:41:17.122
Morgan, anyone ever tell you
you're a little much?

824
00:41:23.796 --> 00:41:25.564
Why didn't you tell me
that he said that?

825
00:41:28.033 --> 00:41:29.499
You were so into him,

826
00:41:29.501 --> 00:41:32.035
and you can't say shit like
that to your best friend

827
00:41:32.037 --> 00:41:34.372
when your best friend's
in love with somebody.

828
00:41:36.408 --> 00:41:39.075
It didn't hurt my feelings.

829
00:41:39.077 --> 00:41:41.480
Well, a little bit. It hurt
my feelings a little bit.

830
00:41:42.815 --> 00:41:44.650
Morgan. Hey.

831
00:41:45.585 --> 00:41:46.519
I'm really sorry.

832
00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:48.320
I'm sorry too.

833
00:41:49.655 --> 00:41:50.456
I'm sorry he died.

834
00:41:51.524 --> 00:41:52.390
Oh, God.

835
00:41:53.291 --> 00:41:55.225
What do we do
with this thing?

836
00:41:55.227 --> 00:41:56.727
I don't even know
what this thing is

837
00:41:56.729 --> 00:41:58.629
or what it does, or anything.

838
00:41:58.631 --> 00:42:01.432
God, I feel like such an
idiot about all this.

839
00:42:01.434 --> 00:42:02.800
I mean, I met his parents.

840
00:42:02.802 --> 00:42:04.568
They were so normal.

841
00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:06.370
Their names
are Tom and Marsha.

842
00:42:06.372 --> 00:42:08.539
The night
before he disappeared,

843
00:42:08.541 --> 00:42:10.206
we all went
to The Cheesecake Factory.

844
00:42:10.208 --> 00:42:12.175
Oh, my God, that menu.

845
00:42:12.177 --> 00:42:14.812
Dostoevsky wrote that menu.

846
00:42:14.814 --> 00:42:18.616
Who introduces people that
don't matter to their parents?

847
00:42:18.618 --> 00:42:20.651
Well, I do. I introduce
everyone to my parents.

848
00:42:20.653 --> 00:42:23.187
But that's their gain,
'cause my parents are magic.

849
00:42:23.189 --> 00:42:25.189
- Do you think they knew?
- I don't know.

850
00:42:25.191 --> 00:42:27.091
I just wish
that he was still alive,

851
00:42:27.093 --> 00:42:28.227
so I could get some answers.

852
00:42:29.629 --> 00:42:31.462
And then I would tell him
to fucking die.

853
00:42:41.307 --> 00:42:42.308
Open it.

854
00:42:43.809 --> 00:42:44.810
Fuck!

855
00:42:46.312 --> 00:42:47.313
There.

856
00:42:49.615 --> 00:42:51.282
What the fuck is that?

857
00:42:51.284 --> 00:42:53.250
It's a flash drive.

858
00:42:53.252 --> 00:42:54.552
They were killing
each other for this?

859
00:42:54.554 --> 00:42:56.220
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

860
00:42:56.222 --> 00:42:58.322
You know who would know
what we should do right now?

861
00:42:58.324 --> 00:43:00.892
- No.
- My father is a brilliant attorney...

862
00:43:00.894 --> 00:43:03.627
- No. Mmm-mmm.
- ...who has represented people

863
00:43:03.629 --> 00:43:06.263
who are in much worse trouble
than we are right now.

864
00:43:06.265 --> 00:43:08.232
No. Your dad would be
furious at us

865
00:43:08.234 --> 00:43:10.234
for breaking a million
international laws.

866
00:43:10.236 --> 00:43:11.569
No. He's not gonna be mad.

867
00:43:11.571 --> 00:43:13.270
He wasn't mad
when I tried cocaine

868
00:43:13.272 --> 00:43:14.773
with my basketball coach.

869
00:43:14.775 --> 00:43:17.876
He wasn't mad at me when
I got deported from Belize.

870
00:43:17.878 --> 00:43:20.477
He didn't get mad when I
invited that teenage magician

871
00:43:20.479 --> 00:43:22.246
to live in my grandma's condo.

872
00:43:22.248 --> 00:43:24.517
Oh, yeah.
What ever happened to him?

873
00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:29.590
You're not gonna believe this.
He disappeared.

874
00:43:30.489 --> 00:43:32.624
Shut up.

875
00:43:32.626 --> 00:43:35.159
No, he actually...
He is a missing person.

876
00:43:49.543 --> 00:43:51.610
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Mom, it's me.

877
00:43:51.612 --> 00:43:54.679
Oh, thank God!
Arnie, she's okay!

878
00:43:54.681 --> 00:43:56.450
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>I'm gonna conference your father in.</i>

879
00:43:57.684 --> 00:43:59.519
- This is Arnie.
- <i>Hi, Dad.</i>

880
00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.455
Hey, button! Hi!

881
00:44:02.823 --> 00:44:04.255
You're all over the papers.

882
00:44:04.257 --> 00:44:05.690
I'm so proud of you.

883
00:44:05.692 --> 00:44:06.827
I always knew the world
would write about you.

884
00:44:09.496 --> 00:44:10.795
Did you color your hair?
You look like a princess.

885
00:44:10.797 --> 00:44:12.297
Sweetie, let me ask you.

886
00:44:12.299 --> 00:44:13.965
Did you and Audrey
murder two people?

887
00:44:13.967 --> 00:44:15.467
Tell me the truth.
I can get you out of it.

888
00:44:15.469 --> 00:44:17.469
No, what happened was,
I murdered one person,

889
00:44:17.471 --> 00:44:18.839
- but it was an assassin, so...
- Shh!

890
00:44:19.806 --> 00:44:21.239
So it didn't count.

891
00:44:21.241 --> 00:44:22.607
No, it doesn't count.

892
00:44:22.609 --> 00:44:24.909
- And Audrey murdered a bunch of people in Austria.
- Oh, my God!

893
00:44:24.911 --> 00:44:27.245
- But it was self-defense.
- Also fine.

894
00:44:27.247 --> 00:44:28.747
Her boyfriend was murdered
in front of us.

895
00:44:28.749 --> 00:44:31.850
- The handsome one?
- I mean, he was fine, I guess.

896
00:44:31.852 --> 00:44:34.819
Oh, you know who's really
handsome is Patrick Dempsey.

897
00:44:34.821 --> 00:44:37.689
- Where are you now, sweetie?
- <i>I'm in Prague.</i>

898
00:44:37.691 --> 00:44:39.892
I don't care for
Eastern Europe. Too gothic.

899
00:44:39.894 --> 00:44:42.394
<i>Okay, listen. I got
a place where you can hide.</i>

900
00:44:42.396 --> 00:44:44.496
- Okay.
- I got a friend, Roger Bernstein.

901
00:44:44.498 --> 00:44:46.798
Lives in Prague.
Guy owes me a favor.

902
00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.267
Dad represented Roger
in a malpractice suit.

903
00:44:49.269 --> 00:44:51.804
<i>Whoa, Carol,
you know who's handsome?</i>

904
00:44:51.806 --> 00:44:54.006
Woody Harrelson.
You know, people don't think it.

905
00:44:54.008 --> 00:44:56.441
I find him handsome.

906
00:44:56.443 --> 00:44:58.543
- <i>She fell over.</i>
- <i>Yeah, I did, actually.</i>

907
00:44:58.545 --> 00:45:00.679
<i>There was one moment
I thought I was gonna die.</i>

908
00:45:00.681 --> 00:45:01.947
<i>Yeah. They've got something
wrong with them.</i>

909
00:45:01.949 --> 00:45:02.750
Morgan...

910
00:45:06.688 --> 00:45:08.522
...disappeared from their LA
apartment, murdered Ukrainian...

911
00:45:10.257 --> 00:45:12.257
Now. Now.
We gotta go.

912
00:45:12.259 --> 00:45:13.759
- <i>Remember the Dingle twins?</i>
- Mom...

913
00:45:13.761 --> 00:45:14.927
We gotta go.

914
00:45:14.929 --> 00:45:16.496
Come on.
Come on. Now!

915
00:45:57.538 --> 00:45:58.938
Who am I looking for?

916
00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:00.439
<i>I texted pictures.</i>

917
00:46:00.441 --> 00:46:02.643
<i>Targets are two dumb
American women.</i>

918
00:46:38.847 --> 00:46:39.980
Oh, my God!

919
00:46:39.982 --> 00:46:41.014
Oh!

920
00:46:41.016 --> 00:46:42.348
You're lagging.

921
00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:43.351
You're lagging.

922
00:46:46.989 --> 00:46:50.891
Shit. Okay. We need to find
Karlova Street.

923
00:46:50.893 --> 00:46:52.993
Looks like Elephant Valley
is on the left.

924
00:46:52.995 --> 00:46:55.798
We're gonna pass the Pavilion
of Big Tortoises in a second.

925
00:46:56.999 --> 00:46:58.633
Morgan, this is a map
of the zoo.

926
00:47:09.878 --> 00:47:10.679
Okay.

927
00:47:16.819 --> 00:47:18.417
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Yes, Roger,

928
00:47:18.419 --> 00:47:20.053
it's Arnie's daughter.
He called.

929
00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:22.825
Go. Thank you!

930
00:47:27.062 --> 00:47:28.662
<i>You know, it's funny.</i>

931
00:47:28.664 --> 00:47:30.564
I remember one time,
back in the day,

932
00:47:30.566 --> 00:47:33.733
your dad and I were getting
ready to go out in the Hamptons.

933
00:47:33.735 --> 00:47:35.669
Your dad had
his sunglasses on.

934
00:47:35.671 --> 00:47:38.038
He turned his collar up.
He looked super.

935
00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.040
We get to the disco,
the guy says to him,

936
00:47:40.042 --> 00:47:42.008
"Sir, sir,
your collar is up."

937
00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:44.544
Ruined the whole effect.

938
00:47:44.546 --> 00:47:46.012
Hope you don't think
I'm being presumptuous,

939
00:47:46.014 --> 00:47:48.750
but I thought you gals looked
like you'd enjoy some pot

940
00:47:50.652 --> 00:47:51.852
roast.

941
00:47:53.856 --> 00:47:56.558
I'm okay. I'm actually...
I'm so sorry. I am a vegan.

942
00:47:56.825 --> 00:47:58.592
Oh.

943
00:47:58.594 --> 00:48:00.694
Morgan, you're not a vegan.

944
00:48:00.696 --> 00:48:02.662
What? 'Cause of the bacon?

945
00:48:02.664 --> 00:48:04.431
Bacon's meat!

946
00:48:04.433 --> 00:48:06.433
Well, listen. At least let me
get you a little vino, okay?

947
00:48:06.435 --> 00:48:07.767
I mean, the only
animal cruelty involved

948
00:48:07.769 --> 00:48:09.970
in that is what the wine guy
charges me.

949
00:48:11.007 --> 00:48:12.939
I actually like to keep
all the best bottles

950
00:48:12.941 --> 00:48:15.508
over there in the study.
It's like a...

951
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:17.078
It's sort of like my homage

952
00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:19.512
- to all the great storytellers.
- Yeah.

953
00:48:19.514 --> 00:48:21.916
- Mmm-hmm.
- Right now, I'm working my way through a grenache noir

954
00:48:21.918 --> 00:48:24.888
while I enjoy a first edition
of <i>La Comedie humaine.</i>

955
00:48:25.454 --> 00:48:28.055
Are you into Balzac?

956
00:48:28.057 --> 00:48:29.893
Less and less with every
experience.

957
00:48:31.493 --> 00:48:32.728
Well, I'll be right back.

958
00:48:33.029 --> 00:48:34.130
Okay.

959
00:48:37.733 --> 00:48:39.967
- It's happening again.
- What is?

960
00:48:39.969 --> 00:48:41.802
He's into me.

961
00:48:41.804 --> 00:48:43.470
What are you talking about?

962
00:48:43.472 --> 00:48:44.906
He wants a slice. Rog.

963
00:48:44.908 --> 00:48:48.477
No, he's just, you know,
like a little weird.

964
00:48:49.812 --> 00:48:52.512
- Older men, they gravitate toward me.
- Okay.

965
00:48:52.514 --> 00:48:53.648
- They love me.
- Oh, God.

966
00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:55.816
They want this.

967
00:48:55.818 --> 00:48:57.484
If that makes them weird

968
00:48:57.486 --> 00:48:59.120
then my SAT math tutor
was weird,

969
00:48:59.122 --> 00:49:00.888
- our landlord is weird.
- He's weird.

970
00:49:00.890 --> 00:49:01.925
Mandy Patinkin is weird.

971
00:49:03.492 --> 00:49:04.792
- Mmm.
- I feel a little nauseated.

972
00:49:04.794 --> 00:49:06.493
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

973
00:49:06.495 --> 00:49:07.597
I'm okay. You just stay.
I'll be right back.

974
00:49:08.064 --> 00:49:09.065
Love you.

975
00:49:12.502 --> 00:49:14.635
Hi. Audrey okay?

976
00:49:14.637 --> 00:49:17.004
Oh, yeah, she's fine.
She's finished. So am I.

977
00:49:17.006 --> 00:49:19.609
Well, at least
let me give you a <i>digestif.</i>

978
00:49:27.283 --> 00:49:28.683
Ah! It's dry.

979
00:49:28.685 --> 00:49:31.152
So are you a lover of art?

980
00:49:31.154 --> 00:49:34.557
Yeah, yeah, oh, lot of art.
Love art.

981
00:49:37.527 --> 00:49:39.126
And look at that art.

982
00:49:39.128 --> 00:49:41.963
Doesn't look like she's
enjoying herself too much.

983
00:49:41.965 --> 00:49:43.864
Sometimes
the sweetest pleasure comes

984
00:49:43.866 --> 00:49:45.169
when you're not enjoying
yourself.

985
00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:48.838
Don't know
that I agree with that.

986
00:49:49.806 --> 00:49:50.873
You wouldn't?

987
00:49:51.774 --> 00:49:53.509
Okay. We're doing
a massage now.

988
00:49:55.145 --> 00:49:55.945
Here we go.

989
00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:01.551
Oh, my God!

990
00:50:02.652 --> 00:50:03.953
Oh, my God!

991
00:50:13.931 --> 00:50:17.798
Roger, thank you so much
for having us at your home.

992
00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:20.601
- It's my great pleasure.
- But I just... I don't think...

993
00:50:20.603 --> 00:50:22.237
I don't think so.

994
00:50:22.239 --> 00:50:24.174
That actually kind...
That kind of hurts.

995
00:50:25.175 --> 00:50:27.708
Huh. Hello.

996
00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:29.577
Who's this? I'm Morgan.

997
00:50:29.579 --> 00:50:31.645
I'm a family friend. Is this your girlfriend?

998
00:50:31.647 --> 00:50:35.150
Nadedja, no. We have to bring them in alive.

999
00:50:35.152 --> 00:50:36.752
Oh, boy.

1000
00:50:40.090 --> 00:50:41.723
Weird.

1001
00:50:44.261 --> 00:50:46.862
Ow. Ow.

1002
00:50:46.864 --> 00:50:48.730
- Audrey.
- Oh, my God!

1003
00:50:48.732 --> 00:50:52.100
Audrey, Roger is bad. Bad.

1004
00:50:52.102 --> 00:50:54.171
No, that's not Roger.

1005
00:50:57.608 --> 00:50:58.709
That's Roger.

1006
00:50:59.877 --> 00:51:01.278
Ah!

1007
00:51:02.713 --> 00:51:03.647
They want the drive.

1008
00:51:05.315 --> 00:51:07.749
You have to swallow it
before they come back.

1009
00:51:07.751 --> 00:51:09.618
- What?
- I have thrown up, like, nine times.

1010
00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:11.019
- What?
- I can't do it.

1011
00:51:11.021 --> 00:51:14.089
Well, I can't
swallow anything.

1012
00:51:14.091 --> 00:51:16.091
I can't even swallow Advil.

1013
00:51:16.093 --> 00:51:18.260
I have to crush it up
in my applesauce.

1014
00:51:18.262 --> 00:51:20.128
No. You gotta swallow this.

1015
00:51:20.130 --> 00:51:20.931
No, I... Oh!

1016
00:51:22.833 --> 00:51:25.834
Fine. Okay.
If you really want me to.

1017
00:51:25.836 --> 00:51:27.903
Oh, my God,
you're heavy.

1018
00:51:27.905 --> 00:51:30.772
- Shut the fuck up, bitch.
- Okay.

1019
00:51:30.774 --> 00:51:32.076
- Yeah. Ah!
- Ah!

1020
00:51:33.043 --> 00:51:34.044
Okay.

1021
00:51:35.112 --> 00:51:36.914
- Ah.
- Close your nose.

1022
00:51:43.121 --> 00:51:44.420
Shit! Shit!

1023
00:51:44.422 --> 00:51:46.322
Let's try it
one more time.

1024
00:51:46.324 --> 00:51:50.126
Ah. Ooh. Ah!

1025
00:51:50.128 --> 00:51:51.693
Whoa!

1026
00:51:51.695 --> 00:51:52.963
No, keep it in.

1027
00:51:59.003 --> 00:52:00.303
I can't.

1028
00:52:00.305 --> 00:52:01.106
Shit!

1029
00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:02.941
I can't do it.

1030
00:52:03.942 --> 00:52:04.976
I tried.

1031
00:52:11.682 --> 00:52:12.884
Uh-oh.

1032
00:52:14.152 --> 00:52:15.320
There's the ice cream lady.

1033
00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:00.165
Audrey.

1034
00:53:00.899 --> 00:53:01.900
Audrey.

1035
00:53:03.935 --> 00:53:04.936
Are you okay?

1036
00:53:06.405 --> 00:53:07.205
Oh, God.

1037
00:53:08.474 --> 00:53:10.409
Oh, God. I don't...
I don't know.

1038
00:53:13.044 --> 00:53:15.211
- Where the fuck are we?
- I don't know.

1039
00:53:15.213 --> 00:53:18.382
Audrey,
how are you feelin'?

1040
00:53:18.384 --> 00:53:21.351
Marsha, Tom. Those are...
Those are Drew's parents.

1041
00:53:21.353 --> 00:53:24.020
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry that
you got dragged into this.

1042
00:53:24.022 --> 00:53:26.155
I never meant for Drew to die.

1043
00:53:26.157 --> 00:53:27.524
We know you didn't, Audrey.

1044
00:53:27.526 --> 00:53:29.526
We're just glad
you're alive.

1045
00:53:29.528 --> 00:53:32.795
Will you untie us before they come
back and tie you up too? Please.

1046
00:53:32.797 --> 00:53:34.366
So where's the drive?

1047
00:53:35.234 --> 00:53:36.766
Oh.

1048
00:53:36.768 --> 00:53:37.501
You know about that?

1049
00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:40.370
Shut up, you dumb bitch.

1050
00:53:40.372 --> 00:53:41.405
Fuck you!

1051
00:53:41.407 --> 00:53:43.806
You wanna tell your friend
to answer the question?

1052
00:53:43.808 --> 00:53:46.145
Trust me, your son would've
wanted you to protect us.

1053
00:53:47.346 --> 00:53:49.112
Audrey...

1054
00:53:49.114 --> 00:53:51.381
I don't think those
are Drew's parents.

1055
00:53:51.383 --> 00:53:53.083
- Of course, they are.
- No.

1056
00:53:53.085 --> 00:53:55.185
We went out
to The Cheesecake Factory.

1057
00:53:55.187 --> 00:53:56.920
We shared
chicken lettuce cups.

1058
00:53:56.922 --> 00:53:59.990
We were at that restaurant to
negotiate the sale of the drive.

1059
00:53:59.992 --> 00:54:01.858
But we talked
about real things.

1060
00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:03.360
We talked about
Tom's colonoscopy.

1061
00:54:03.362 --> 00:54:04.995
Not getting
a colonoscopy.

1062
00:54:04.997 --> 00:54:07.264
He only took you to the
restaurant as insurance,

1063
00:54:07.266 --> 00:54:09.466
so we wouldn't kill him
if he left with the drive.

1064
00:54:09.468 --> 00:54:11.070
Okay, let's get this done.

1065
00:54:12.238 --> 00:54:14.073
Where is the fucking drive?

1066
00:54:15.407 --> 00:54:16.340
No. No.

1067
00:54:16.342 --> 00:54:19.276
Please, sir.
Sir, please don't.

1068
00:54:19.278 --> 00:54:21.945
That's my best friend.
Please, just...

1069
00:54:21.947 --> 00:54:23.280
I flushed it down the toilet.

1070
00:54:27.052 --> 00:54:28.187
Do you know
what you've done?

1071
00:54:31.323 --> 00:54:32.124
Nadedja.

1072
00:54:40.299 --> 00:54:41.100
Oh, good God.

1073
00:55:03.356 --> 00:55:04.455
What is that?

1074
00:55:21.174 --> 00:55:21.905
<i>Five kilometers out.</i>

1075
00:55:21.907 --> 00:55:24.275
<i>Closing in on the safe house.</i>

1076
00:55:24.277 --> 00:55:26.413
<i>Backup units, be advised,
subjects heavily armed.</i>

1077
00:55:34.454 --> 00:55:36.521
Wow! You're so pretty.

1078
00:55:36.523 --> 00:55:38.990
You're barely human,
you're so pretty.

1079
00:55:38.992 --> 00:55:40.491
And look how flexible
you are.

1080
00:55:40.493 --> 00:55:41.626
Morgan, shut up.

1081
00:55:41.628 --> 00:55:44.395
No, everybody
likes compliments.

1082
00:55:44.397 --> 00:55:45.363
She's definitely
not loving this, Morgan.

1083
00:55:45.365 --> 00:55:47.465
She loves it. It's working.

1084
00:55:47.467 --> 00:55:49.033
You just... You are so...

1085
00:55:49.035 --> 00:55:50.337
You're so bad.

1086
00:55:51.938 --> 00:55:55.440
Oh! Hey! Hey, are you hungry?
I'm hungry.

1087
00:55:55.442 --> 00:55:57.542
You wanna get outta here
and get a bite to eat?

1088
00:55:57.544 --> 00:55:58.378
I like you.

1089
00:56:00.013 --> 00:56:01.281
Oh, my God!

1090
00:56:11.124 --> 00:56:12.459
Shit! They got the drive.

1091
00:56:13.694 --> 00:56:15.493
Fuck!

1092
00:56:15.495 --> 00:56:17.495
All right, kids, on my count,
send the grenades in.

1093
00:56:17.497 --> 00:56:20.398
- Let's blow this motherfucker up.
- Wait! The girls could still be in there.

1094
00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:21.566
Yeah, and if they are,
they're either surrounded

1095
00:56:21.568 --> 00:56:23.234
by terrorists or dead.

1096
00:56:23.236 --> 00:56:25.103
- Also, I don't care.
- Just give me five minutes

1097
00:56:25.105 --> 00:56:26.572
and three agents.
I need to check.

1098
00:56:26.574 --> 00:56:28.039
Oh, so four agents can die?

1099
00:56:28.041 --> 00:56:30.141
You know this is
my operation, right?

1100
00:56:30.143 --> 00:56:32.477
So just sit tight,
and let's crush this mother

1101
00:56:32.479 --> 00:56:35.346
the way we crushed Yale at
football nine years in a row.

1102
00:56:35.348 --> 00:56:38.383
And by "we," I mean Harvard.
Let's blow 'em up.

1103
00:56:38.385 --> 00:56:39.984
- <i>Roger that.</i>
- Watch the show.

1104
00:56:42.723 --> 00:56:45.289
Uh...

1105
00:56:45.291 --> 00:56:47.927
Actually, guys, hold up.
Abort mission.

1106
00:56:49.062 --> 00:56:50.230
- <i>Copy that.</i>
- Go Crimson.

1107
00:56:58.672 --> 00:57:03.143
I ask question. If I don't
like answer, you feel pain.

1108
00:57:05.346 --> 00:57:06.347
Same as her.

1109
00:57:07.314 --> 00:57:09.448
It looks worse than it is.

1110
00:57:09.450 --> 00:57:11.517
I have freakishly
strong teeth.

1111
00:57:11.519 --> 00:57:14.422
I had braces for nine years. My
orthodontist published a paper.

1112
00:57:15.689 --> 00:57:17.989
Where is drive?

1113
00:57:17.991 --> 00:57:20.261
I already told you.
I flushed it down the toilet.

1114
00:57:22.296 --> 00:57:26.598
You lie. No, I don't.
I don't lie. No.

1115
00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:29.370
Oh, my God!

1116
00:57:32.473 --> 00:57:34.106
Please,
I'm begging you. Please.

1117
00:57:34.108 --> 00:57:35.176
Please, do me a favor

1118
00:57:36.143 --> 00:57:37.445
and eat my tit, bitch.

1119
00:57:38.345 --> 00:57:40.448
And please, please.
Please, just please

1120
00:57:41.148 --> 00:57:42.183
go fuck yourself.

1121
00:57:43.617 --> 00:57:44.516
'Cause I'd love it

1122
00:57:44.518 --> 00:57:46.654
if you would please just
go fuck yourself.

1123
00:58:11.212 --> 00:58:14.714
Trust me that I'm a terrible,
terrible liar.

1124
00:58:14.716 --> 00:58:18.484
- Everybody knows when I'm lying.
- I can't lie.

1125
00:58:18.486 --> 00:58:20.753
Me, too. I've never kept
a secret in my life.

1126
00:58:20.755 --> 00:58:22.354
Secrets are poison.

1127
00:58:22.356 --> 00:58:24.223
Maybe you keep
secret for her.

1128
00:58:24.225 --> 00:58:26.793
No, I'll tell you anything
that you wanna know about her.

1129
00:58:26.795 --> 00:58:27.662
'Cause I know it all.

1130
00:58:28.730 --> 00:58:31.464
She texts and drives.
She does it all the time.

1131
00:58:31.466 --> 00:58:34.434
She Instagrams on the freeway.
She hashtags it "driving."

1132
00:58:34.436 --> 00:58:36.636
- What are you doing?
- I'm proving to her that

1133
00:58:36.638 --> 00:58:38.438
we don't keep secrets. Just
tell her something about me.

1134
00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:40.540
Okay, okay. Um,

1135
00:58:40.542 --> 00:58:42.842
Morgan stole her dad's
pain pills after his surgery

1136
00:58:42.844 --> 00:58:44.611
- and sold them at Coachella.
- I did.

1137
00:58:44.613 --> 00:58:47.380
Audrey was once babysitting
this eight-year-old kid

1138
00:58:47.382 --> 00:58:49.682
and she flirted with him
to get him to go to sleep.

1139
00:58:49.684 --> 00:58:51.083
His name was Liam.

1140
00:58:51.085 --> 00:58:52.619
She has sex dreams
about Minions.

1141
00:58:52.621 --> 00:58:55.421
Just the one Minion
with the one eye.

1142
00:58:55.423 --> 00:58:57.223
Is that supposed to be a dick?

1143
00:58:57.225 --> 00:58:58.825
She googled it
on my computer,

1144
00:58:58.827 --> 00:59:00.695
and now I get
a lot of weird ads.

1145
00:59:01.463 --> 00:59:03.095
I said I was sorry.

1146
00:59:03.097 --> 00:59:04.466
Audrey shaves
between her boobs.

1147
00:59:05.367 --> 00:59:06.432
Uh, Morgan kissed her cousin.

1148
00:59:06.434 --> 00:59:08.868
- I didn't know it was my cousin.
- Morgan has HPV.

1149
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:10.503
Audrey has HPV.

1150
00:59:10.505 --> 00:59:12.138
Morgan had sex
in a playground once.

1151
00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:13.439
Audrey hit a dog
in the face.

1152
00:59:13.441 --> 00:59:15.108
Morgan had lice as an adult.

1153
00:59:15.110 --> 00:59:17.143
Audrey can't come 'cause
she's on antidepressants.

1154
00:59:17.145 --> 00:59:19.047
I can! It just takes me
a very long time.

1155
00:59:20.248 --> 00:59:21.648
Oh, look.

1156
00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:23.716
Hey, hey.

1157
00:59:23.718 --> 00:59:25.752
- It's working. It's working.
- Yeah.

1158
00:59:25.754 --> 00:59:27.122
What else do you wanna know?
We'll tell you anything.

1159
00:59:28.790 --> 00:59:30.292
How you know
so much about her?

1160
00:59:30.893 --> 00:59:33.226
And she about you?

1161
00:59:33.228 --> 00:59:36.596
She's my best friend. We know
everything about each other.

1162
00:59:36.598 --> 00:59:38.331
You have a best friend, right?

1163
00:59:38.333 --> 00:59:39.232
Of course
she has a best friend.

1164
00:59:39.234 --> 00:59:40.366
- Yeah.
- Look at her.

1165
00:59:40.368 --> 00:59:43.403
You're so charming, and you
have so many good hobbies.

1166
00:59:43.405 --> 00:59:44.805
- Hobbies.
- You do...

1167
00:59:44.807 --> 00:59:46.408
- You do have a best friend.
- Yeah.

1168
00:59:47.877 --> 00:59:49.709
Tell us
about your best friend.

1169
00:59:49.711 --> 00:59:51.446
- Who is she?
- What's her name? What does she look like?

1170
00:59:51.914 --> 00:59:53.114
Bobik.

1171
00:59:54.182 --> 00:59:56.482
- Bobik?
- Bobik.

1172
00:59:56.484 --> 00:59:59.287
- Oh.
- Tell us about her. Tell us everything about her.

1173
01:00:04.492 --> 01:00:05.327
Bobik.

1174
01:00:07.563 --> 01:00:09.195
- It's a balance beam.
- Oh.

1175
01:00:09.197 --> 01:00:10.631
It's a fucking balance beam.

1176
01:00:10.633 --> 01:00:11.899
- Oh, God, no.
- Your balance beam's

1177
01:00:11.901 --> 01:00:13.435
- your best fucking friend?
- What? Ah, no, no.

1178
01:00:23.311 --> 01:00:24.480
Oh, fuck.

1179
01:00:26.782 --> 01:00:28.183
Oh, fuck.

1180
01:00:29.385 --> 01:00:30.684
You fucking dick, Henshaw!

1181
01:00:33.456 --> 01:00:34.457
Fuck!

1182
01:00:36.959 --> 01:00:39.860
Okay. Light it up.

1183
01:00:39.862 --> 01:00:41.364
<i>Copy.
Sending in the grenades.</i>

1184
01:00:56.712 --> 01:00:57.878
What?
Oh, my God!

1185
01:00:58.981 --> 01:01:00.182
Who's that?

1186
01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:09.325
Oh, my God!

1187
01:01:28.744 --> 01:01:29.545
- Yes!
- Oh!

1188
01:01:42.759 --> 01:01:43.858
Sebastian!

1189
01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:45.026
- Hello.
- Oh, my God!

1190
01:01:48.564 --> 01:01:50.199
- Stay close.
- Thank you so much!

1191
01:01:50.599 --> 01:01:52.636
Oh, my God!

1192
01:02:03.613 --> 01:02:04.713
Oh, my God!

1193
01:02:18.995 --> 01:02:20.729
Okay, I trust you now.

1194
01:02:20.731 --> 01:02:22.532
Jesus,
I should hope so.

1195
01:02:24.334 --> 01:02:25.602
Show me your hands.
Show me your hands.

1196
01:02:26.636 --> 01:02:27.637
What?

1197
01:02:31.341 --> 01:02:32.309
Get in the fucking car.

1198
01:02:34.644 --> 01:02:35.645
Us?

1199
01:02:45.756 --> 01:02:49.624
I thought that the international
intelligence office would be fancier.

1200
01:02:49.626 --> 01:02:51.025
It's a temporary space.

1201
01:02:51.027 --> 01:02:53.328
We don't wanna
call attention to ourselves.

1202
01:02:53.330 --> 01:02:55.029
I know, but can you
hang a poster?

1203
01:02:55.031 --> 01:02:56.664
Can we get a drape?
Something?

1204
01:02:56.666 --> 01:02:58.833
This is what our tax dollars
are paying for?

1205
01:02:58.835 --> 01:03:00.737
You haven't paid
your taxes for three years.

1206
01:03:01.338 --> 01:03:03.038
You know that?

1207
01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.773
Hey, look,
Sebastian, I'm really sorry

1208
01:03:04.775 --> 01:03:06.341
I didn't give you
the drive at that cafe.

1209
01:03:06.343 --> 01:03:08.512
Nah. No, I understand.

1210
01:03:09.479 --> 01:03:11.346
Drew told you
to keep it safe.

1211
01:03:11.348 --> 01:03:13.416
Can you at least tell us
what's on that drive?

1212
01:03:15.786 --> 01:03:17.385
All we know is,

1213
01:03:17.387 --> 01:03:19.487
it was made by an
international terrorist group

1214
01:03:19.489 --> 01:03:20.990
named Highland.

1215
01:03:20.992 --> 01:03:23.794
Intelligence tells us they're
planning a series of attacks.

1216
01:03:24.761 --> 01:03:26.696
If we had it,
we'd know how to stop them.

1217
01:03:31.035 --> 01:03:32.502
Henshaw, my office.

1218
01:03:34.371 --> 01:03:36.906
What? Wait, wait.

1219
01:03:36.908 --> 01:03:39.507
This is your boss?
You're the boss?

1220
01:03:39.509 --> 01:03:41.677
We have a real-life
Judi Dench in our midst.

1221
01:03:41.679 --> 01:03:43.979
You are the boss, and yet
you have not sacrificed

1222
01:03:43.981 --> 01:03:46.381
one ounce of femininity.

1223
01:03:46.383 --> 01:03:48.984
Why have we been spending all of
this time talking to the men,

1224
01:03:48.986 --> 01:03:51.987
when this being has been
floating through the halls

1225
01:03:51.989 --> 01:03:54.023
of the building?
Oh, my God!

1226
01:03:54.025 --> 01:03:57.392
- That's a compliment.
- That is the Beyonce of the government.

1227
01:03:57.394 --> 01:03:59.530
Duffer, stay here.

1228
01:04:01.566 --> 01:04:03.599
I have so much respect
for you that it has

1229
01:04:03.601 --> 01:04:05.703
circled around
into objectification.

1230
01:04:06.070 --> 01:04:07.736
Ma'am!

1231
01:04:07.738 --> 01:04:10.172
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I know I overstepped.

1232
01:04:10.174 --> 01:04:11.841
Overstepped? No.

1233
01:04:11.843 --> 01:04:14.944
I'd say what you did
was closer to treason.

1234
01:04:14.946 --> 01:04:18.113
Treason? I was
merely trying to help.

1235
01:04:18.115 --> 01:04:22.117
How long did your doctor say that
your arm would take to heal?

1236
01:04:22.119 --> 01:04:23.853
Um, three months
for the bullet wound,

1237
01:04:23.855 --> 01:04:26.055
- one for the sprain.
- Fantastic.

1238
01:04:26.057 --> 01:04:27.523
Take four months' leave.

1239
01:04:27.525 --> 01:04:28.958
Oh, no. I assume he meant

1240
01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:30.659
the two would
heal simultaneously.

1241
01:04:30.661 --> 01:04:31.529
I know what I said.

1242
01:04:32.864 --> 01:04:34.096
<i>Please
take me through this.</i>

1243
01:04:34.098 --> 01:04:36.699
What exactly was
going through your mind

1244
01:04:36.701 --> 01:04:38.667
when you flushed it
down the toilet?

1245
01:04:38.669 --> 01:04:40.736
Were you thinking,
"Oh, I know.

1246
01:04:40.738 --> 01:04:42.205
"People are dying
because of this.

1247
01:04:42.207 --> 01:04:43.806
"So here's what I'll do.

1248
01:04:43.808 --> 01:04:45.608
"I'll treat it like
a piece of shit,

1249
01:04:45.610 --> 01:04:46.942
"wrapped up in toilet paper,

1250
01:04:46.944 --> 01:04:48.679
"and then flush it
down the toilet"?

1251
01:04:51.049 --> 01:04:53.216
Oh, this is funny?
Death is funny to you?

1252
01:04:53.218 --> 01:04:54.518
No, I'm sorry.

1253
01:04:55.586 --> 01:04:57.519
But that's how
you go to the bathroom?

1254
01:04:57.521 --> 01:04:59.155
Oh, great. Okay. Awesome.

1255
01:04:59.157 --> 01:05:00.656
Great. You two laugh.

1256
01:05:00.658 --> 01:05:03.159
Meanwhile, let me tell you
how many people have died

1257
01:05:03.161 --> 01:05:04.930
and will die
because of your stupidity.

1258
01:05:08.466 --> 01:05:10.499
I'm sorry. Just let me
get this straight.

1259
01:05:10.501 --> 01:05:12.501
So you wrap your hands
in toilet paper,

1260
01:05:12.503 --> 01:05:13.736
and then you poop
into that,

1261
01:05:13.738 --> 01:05:15.471
and then that
whole contraption

1262
01:05:15.473 --> 01:05:16.806
is what you drop
into the toilet?

1263
01:05:16.808 --> 01:05:18.909
- That was just a metaphor.
- You know that the toilet is designed

1264
01:05:18.911 --> 01:05:20.643
to take the work
out of it for you, right?

1265
01:05:20.645 --> 01:05:22.078
No, that's not
what I was saying.

1266
01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:24.247
I was say...
I didn't say that.

1267
01:05:24.249 --> 01:05:26.082
I poop normally.
Like everybody else.

1268
01:05:26.084 --> 01:05:28.720
Of course, yes. I know.
I'm sorry. Okay.

1269
01:05:30.756 --> 01:05:33.555
Hey, uh, I wanna say goodbye.

1270
01:05:33.557 --> 01:05:34.660
Where are you going?

1271
01:05:37.195 --> 01:05:38.795
I've been suspended.

1272
01:05:38.797 --> 01:05:41.164
You two are to go
back to Los Angeles.

1273
01:05:41.166 --> 01:05:42.933
- What?
- What?

1274
01:05:42.935 --> 01:05:45.902
Duffer, transport these women
to de Gaulle.

1275
01:05:45.904 --> 01:05:47.839
Ma'am. Ma'am. Ma'am.

1276
01:05:49.574 --> 01:05:51.574
Please don't send us home.

1277
01:05:51.576 --> 01:05:54.577
Spying, not easy.
We know that now.

1278
01:05:54.579 --> 01:05:58.214
But we have been a real help
to this operation,

1279
01:05:58.216 --> 01:06:01.751
and I know the drive is gone,
but we are in this, boss.

1280
01:06:01.753 --> 01:06:04.087
And if you would
just give us a chance,

1281
01:06:04.089 --> 01:06:07.657
I think that we could be
a major resource for you.

1282
01:06:07.659 --> 01:06:11.964
Would you consider
keeping us on

1283
01:06:13.565 --> 01:06:15.934
in this intelligence bureau?

1284
01:06:17.303 --> 01:06:19.938
Please. Ma'am.

1285
01:06:22.708 --> 01:06:23.709
Okay.

1286
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:26.576
All right.

1287
01:06:26.578 --> 01:06:29.514
I am going to take
a chance on you two.

1288
01:06:30.782 --> 01:06:31.783
Really?

1289
01:06:32.318 --> 01:06:33.852
I could really use you.

1290
01:06:34.586 --> 01:06:35.952
What?

1291
01:06:35.954 --> 01:06:36.989
Are you serious?

1292
01:06:38.157 --> 01:06:39.158
No.

1293
01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:42.995
Their flight
leaves in four hours.

1294
01:06:46.631 --> 01:06:49.699
Hey, Morgan, I think that we
should probably just head out.

1295
01:06:49.701 --> 01:06:52.736
The fact that we even survived
this is just dumb luck.

1296
01:06:52.738 --> 01:06:54.005
I really just wanna go home.

1297
01:06:54.007 --> 01:06:55.839
What? Why would you
wanna go home

1298
01:06:55.841 --> 01:06:57.174
in the middle of all this?

1299
01:06:57.176 --> 01:06:58.175
We're a part of this.

1300
01:06:58.177 --> 01:07:00.046
Come on, this isn't...
This isn't who we are.

1301
01:07:01.347 --> 01:07:03.249
Okay? We've done enough.

1302
01:07:04.616 --> 01:07:06.585
Can we please
just go home?

1303
01:07:08.254 --> 01:07:09.255
I'm done.

1304
01:07:10.923 --> 01:07:14.091
- Morgan, now.
- Okay. Yes. Yes.

1305
01:07:14.093 --> 01:07:16.626
That's a great idea. Hey, Seb,
why don't you drop 'em off

1306
01:07:16.628 --> 01:07:18.029
at the airport
on your way home?

1307
01:07:18.031 --> 01:07:19.930
It'll prepare you
for your next career,

1308
01:07:19.932 --> 01:07:21.200
being a SuperShuttle driver.

1309
01:07:36.215 --> 01:07:37.948
Out of curiosity,

1310
01:07:37.950 --> 01:07:40.217
if we still had the drive,
what would've happened?

1311
01:07:40.219 --> 01:07:42.253
- Hypothetically?
- Yeah.

1312
01:07:42.255 --> 01:07:44.021
Uh, I'd figure out
how to de-encrypt it,

1313
01:07:44.023 --> 01:07:47.324
then see what Highland's
plans are and stop them.

1314
01:07:47.326 --> 01:07:49.262
How do you de-encrypt
something like that?

1315
01:07:50.296 --> 01:07:52.031
Why do you wanna
know all this?

1316
01:07:53.633 --> 01:07:55.034
Because the drive
is in my vagina.

1317
01:07:59.272 --> 01:08:00.539
- What?
- What?

1318
01:08:00.541 --> 01:08:02.706
I mean, look, everybody kept
saying that it was so important,

1319
01:08:02.708 --> 01:08:04.942
and I wasn't gonna flush something
that important down the toilet.

1320
01:08:04.944 --> 01:08:06.243
Why didn't you
just give it to Duffer?

1321
01:08:06.245 --> 01:08:07.878
'Cause he's an asshole.

1322
01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:10.214
Wait, so when you said
you wanted to go home...

1323
01:08:10.216 --> 01:08:14.752
Yes, it was because I had the
flash drive in my vagina.

1324
01:08:14.754 --> 01:08:18.122
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1325
01:08:18.124 --> 01:08:20.292
- I know!
- Does it hurt? Does it not hurt?

1326
01:08:20.294 --> 01:08:21.725
You get used to it.

1327
01:08:21.727 --> 01:08:22.960
Wait, so you were lying
to that bitch

1328
01:08:22.962 --> 01:08:24.296
when she was torturing us?

1329
01:08:24.298 --> 01:08:26.131
- Yeah.
- And you lied to me?

1330
01:08:26.133 --> 01:08:27.998
You broke our sacred
bond of trust.

1331
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
I know, Morgan. I'm so sorry.

1332
01:08:30.002 --> 01:08:32.370
But it's okay,
'cause it was amazing!

1333
01:08:32.372 --> 01:08:35.340
I, um... Well, I don't mean to
be impolite about this but...

1334
01:08:35.342 --> 01:08:37.978
Do you think you could
access it from the...

1335
01:08:38.811 --> 01:08:40.145
Place that...

1336
01:08:40.147 --> 01:08:42.280
- In the...
- Oh, yeah.

1337
01:08:42.282 --> 01:08:44.284
- What? Here?
- Just don't look here.

1338
01:08:45.252 --> 01:08:47.452
Oh.

1339
01:08:47.454 --> 01:08:49.921
This is good. You should get it out.
'Cause the ultimate irony would be

1340
01:08:49.923 --> 01:08:52.792
if you saved the world, and then
died of toxic shock syndrome.

1341
01:08:54.428 --> 01:08:58.230
<i>♪ She'll be coming round the
mountain when she comes</i>

1342
01:08:58.232 --> 01:09:00.633
<i>♪ She'll be coming round the
mountain when she comes ♪</i>

1343
01:09:01.935 --> 01:09:03.135
- Okay.
- Oh, there it is.

1344
01:09:03.137 --> 01:09:04.702
Oh.

1345
01:09:04.704 --> 01:09:06.037
Should I put it in the...

1346
01:09:06.039 --> 01:09:08.039
- No. I'll, uh...
- Like, a tissue?

1347
01:09:08.041 --> 01:09:10.043
No, no, no.
I'll take it. I'll take it.

1348
01:09:15.182 --> 01:09:17.315
So are you gonna use that
to get your job back?

1349
01:09:17.317 --> 01:09:19.751
People at my job
just tried to kill all of us,

1350
01:09:19.753 --> 01:09:21.486
so, to be honest, I'm not sure
who to trust anymore.

1351
01:09:21.488 --> 01:09:23.157
But thank you.

1352
01:09:23.891 --> 01:09:26.126
For trusting me.

1353
01:09:28.395 --> 01:09:30.097
Now, will you trust us?

1354
01:09:31.298 --> 01:09:33.064
To help you?

1355
01:09:33.066 --> 01:09:35.501
I mean, you're injured, so I
feel like you kind of need us.

1356
01:09:35.503 --> 01:09:38.236
I mean, we're naturals.
We're operatives.

1357
01:09:38.238 --> 01:09:40.872
We're semi-professionals at this point.
Professional. We are professional.

1358
01:09:56.890 --> 01:09:58.457
So, um...

1359
01:09:58.459 --> 01:10:00.428
Morgan, your idea of
blending in is that outfit?

1360
01:10:01.161 --> 01:10:02.328
Yeah.

1361
01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:05.764
Do I not look
just like a French woman?

1362
01:10:05.766 --> 01:10:07.400
I look like a French woman.

1363
01:10:07.402 --> 01:10:08.936
You look like
a French curtain.

1364
01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:11.172
Yeah, 'cause I can hang.

1365
01:10:11.905 --> 01:10:13.772
- Mmm. Mmm.
- Mmm-hmm?

1366
01:10:13.774 --> 01:10:16.074
Something really weird
on this drive.

1367
01:10:16.076 --> 01:10:17.776
Oh, I'm sorry. Not all of us

1368
01:10:17.778 --> 01:10:19.911
are perfectly waxed
porn stars down there.

1369
01:10:19.913 --> 01:10:21.846
Some of us have stuff.

1370
01:10:21.848 --> 01:10:24.050
Oh, no, I meant
the information on it.

1371
01:10:24.052 --> 01:10:25.551
It's State Department
encryption.

1372
01:10:25.553 --> 01:10:26.787
Oh.

1373
01:10:27.788 --> 01:10:29.090
- Right.
- Figures.

1374
01:10:30.458 --> 01:10:33.292
- What do you mean?
- Meaning Highland didn't make it.

1375
01:10:33.294 --> 01:10:35.094
Your government did.

1376
01:10:35.096 --> 01:10:37.430
I can't access it.
I don't have clearance.

1377
01:10:37.432 --> 01:10:40.132
What do you mean? You're a spy.
Can't you just hack it?

1378
01:10:40.134 --> 01:10:43.169
Well, they change
the password every 24 hours.

1379
01:10:43.171 --> 01:10:45.938
Even if I had a supercomputer,
it'd take days.

1380
01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:47.139
So what are you saying?

1381
01:10:47.141 --> 01:10:50.142
I'm saying we can't
get onto the flash drive.

1382
01:10:50.144 --> 01:10:51.310
- What?
- There's gotta be something else

1383
01:10:51.312 --> 01:10:54.213
- we can do.
- Not unless you have access to an expert

1384
01:10:54.215 --> 01:10:55.850
in U.S. Intelligence
computer security.

1385
01:10:59.454 --> 01:11:00.788
One minute.

1386
01:11:10.298 --> 01:11:11.933
Um...

1387
01:11:15.571 --> 01:11:18.037
Mmm-hmm.

1388
01:11:18.039 --> 01:11:20.906
That's all I
remember from high school French.

1389
01:11:20.908 --> 01:11:22.308
Shit. What were
the lines I had

1390
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:24.010
in that French
student film?

1391
01:11:24.012 --> 01:11:25.380
Um...

1392
01:11:40.028 --> 01:11:41.062
Oh, God.

1393
01:11:44.966 --> 01:11:45.967
No?

1394
01:11:47.869 --> 01:11:51.003
I need to borrow this
for one minute.

1395
01:11:51.005 --> 01:11:52.206
I will be there.

1396
01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.514
Uh-huh. Hmm.

1397
01:12:06.888 --> 01:12:07.589
This is Edward.

1398
01:12:08.524 --> 01:12:11.491
Eddie. Eddie Snowden.

1399
01:12:11.493 --> 01:12:13.926
<i>It's Morgan
from Buck's Rock Camp.</i>

1400
01:12:13.928 --> 01:12:15.164
Oh, my God!

1401
01:12:15.897 --> 01:12:17.166
Morgan. Um...

1402
01:12:17.932 --> 01:12:19.466
Wow! It's been forever.

1403
01:12:19.468 --> 01:12:21.134
I, uh...

1404
01:12:21.136 --> 01:12:22.602
I sent you a bunch of emails
over the years.

1405
01:12:22.604 --> 01:12:24.904
You did? Shoot!

1406
01:12:24.906 --> 01:12:28.308
Well, that's upsetting.
I don't know where they went.

1407
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:31.211
I thought that you might not
have your AOL account anymore.

1408
01:12:31.213 --> 01:12:33.113
Oh, yeah.
I switched to Gmail in '04.

1409
01:12:33.115 --> 01:12:35.916
Oh. Actually, I knew that.

1410
01:12:35.918 --> 01:12:38.118
Right. I guess you would.

1411
01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:39.553
So I've been
following the news.

1412
01:12:39.555 --> 01:12:41.388
<i>Oh, my God. Eddie.</i>

1413
01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:43.123
You have to understand,
we didn't kill anybody.

1414
01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:44.224
On purpose.

1415
01:12:44.226 --> 01:12:46.360
Of course.
It's called a frame job.

1416
01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:48.495
They do that.

1417
01:12:48.497 --> 01:12:51.031
Tell me what you need, Morgan.
I'm here for you.

1418
01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:52.334
Are you near a computer?

1419
01:12:53.969 --> 01:12:55.602
Always.

1420
01:12:55.604 --> 01:12:58.574
A capital H.
Add sign. Lowercase U.

1421
01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:01.076
Lowercase J.

1422
01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:02.976
Percentage sign.

1423
01:13:02.978 --> 01:13:05.047
- Yes, percentage.
- Uppercase Y.

1424
01:13:09.084 --> 01:13:10.219
Oh, my God! That's right.

1425
01:13:10.587 --> 01:13:12.553
Okay. So?

1426
01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:13.590
What are Highland's plans?

1427
01:13:14.724 --> 01:13:17.290
These aren't
Highland's plans.

1428
01:13:17.292 --> 01:13:20.260
This drive is a back door
to the entire Internet.

1429
01:13:20.262 --> 01:13:22.965
Finances, emails.
Everyone's secrets.

1430
01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:26.536
We need to
get out of here now.

1431
01:13:27.637 --> 01:13:29.136
We gotta go.

1432
01:13:29.138 --> 01:13:31.138
- Uh-huh.
- Morgan.

1433
01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:32.941
You call me
if you're ever in LA now.

1434
01:13:33.710 --> 01:13:36.278
LA's gonna be hard.

1435
01:13:48.324 --> 01:13:49.459
<i>I need to add another target.</i>

1436
01:13:50.493 --> 01:13:52.360
- Double rate.
- <i>No.</i>

1437
01:13:52.362 --> 01:13:55.363
<i>You already failed twice.
The girls are still alive.</i>

1438
01:13:55.365 --> 01:13:57.331
<i>Highland is very upset.</i>

1439
01:14:00.002 --> 01:14:01.304
Well, hello, beautiful.

1440
01:14:06.176 --> 01:14:07.508
Baby...

1441
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:08.711
What happened
to your face?

1442
01:14:13.149 --> 01:14:14.117
What happened to yours?

1443
01:14:23.193 --> 01:14:24.425
Where we goin', chief?

1444
01:14:24.427 --> 01:14:26.162
Amsterdam.
We'll be safe there.

1445
01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:28.998
Can I help you?

1446
01:14:30.099 --> 01:14:31.134
Thank you.

1447
01:14:37.373 --> 01:14:38.475
Nice boobs.

1448
01:14:40.477 --> 01:14:41.311
Thanks.

1449
01:14:44.715 --> 01:14:47.984
<i>Remember, the best place to hide
is somewhere full of suspicious people.</i>

1450
01:14:49.452 --> 01:14:52.186
Oh, my God,
is this what crack smells like?

1451
01:14:52.188 --> 01:14:54.155
Is this the couple
you saw at the gymnasium?

1452
01:14:54.157 --> 01:14:55.824
Ivan and Raisa Petrenko.

1453
01:14:55.826 --> 01:14:57.726
Heads of the Highland
crime syndicate.

1454
01:14:57.728 --> 01:14:59.327
- Out of Moscow.
- Oh.

1455
01:14:59.329 --> 01:15:01.529
Oligarchs, arms dealers,
blackmailers,

1456
01:15:01.531 --> 01:15:03.364
and former gymnastic coaches.

1457
01:15:03.366 --> 01:15:07.569
And this is their trained
assassin and former student.

1458
01:15:07.571 --> 01:15:09.538
Not a fan.

1459
01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:11.607
You guys. Audrey, come here.
It's us. We're on the news.

1460
01:15:11.609 --> 01:15:13.207
<i>Thought to be part of
a bigger terrorist plot...</i>

1461

We're on TV.

1462
01:15:14.478 --> 01:15:16.545
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- It's happening.

1463
01:15:16.547 --> 01:15:17.579
<i>...the women were allegedly

<i>which may have had
a sexual motive.</i>

1466
01:15:22.252 --> 01:15:24.419
Sexual motive?
Yeah. He wishes.

1467
01:15:24.421 --> 01:15:26.355
<i>The FBI has

1469
01:15:28.425 --> 01:15:31.293
Oh, shit, Morgan.
It's our chats.

1470
01:15:31.295 --> 01:15:35.297
"I just wish he would die.
Is that too much to ask?"

1471
01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:40.101
"Just for someone to expletive
murder him," said Audrey Stockman

1472
01:15:40.103 --> 01:15:41.303
Oh, my God.

1473
01:15:41.305 --> 01:15:46.208
<i>Then, "Do you want me
to murder him? I totally will.</i>

<i>"Music note emoji. Music note

1476
01:15:54.451 --> 01:15:55.686
Your name is Morgan Freeman.

1477
01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:57.853
I just put that together.

1478
01:15:57.855 --> 01:16:01.390
Yeah. I can always get
a reservation wherever I want.

1479
01:16:01.392 --> 01:16:03.258
<i>Honestly, I just don't believe</i>

1480

- <i>that Audrey would ever do this.</i>
- Oh.

1481
01:16:05.596 --> 01:16:07.896
- <i>She's just not that kind of person.</i>
- Wow, okay.

1482
01:16:07.898 --> 01:16:10.265
<i>You know. She's not
that sophisticated.</i>

1483
01:16:10.267 --> 01:16:11.800
<i>I mean, she's 30 years old,</i>

1484
01:16:11.802 --> 01:16:15.170
<i>and she doesn't even
have a bed frame, so...</i>

1485
01:16:15.172 --> 01:16:17.339
Box spring counts. A box spring counts.

1486
01:16:17.341 --> 01:16:18.607
We've talked about this.

1487
01:16:28.686 --> 01:16:29.788
Americans?

1488
01:16:36.895 --> 01:16:37.696
Hey.

1489
01:16:38.295 --> 01:16:39.296
Hi.

1490
01:16:48.205 --> 01:16:50.742
I hope you're not upset about
what that girl said on the news.

1491
01:16:52.309 --> 01:16:55.477
Oh, well,
I'm not that surprised.

1492
01:16:55.479 --> 01:16:57.279
It's not like
I've done anything

1493
01:16:57.281 --> 01:16:59.515
that impressive with my life.

1494
01:16:59.517 --> 01:17:01.884
I've seen you
do some impressive things.

1495
01:17:01.886 --> 01:17:03.553
You were a great shot
in the cafe.

1496
01:17:03.555 --> 01:17:06.723
You switched
the trophies on me.

1497
01:17:06.725 --> 01:17:08.891
You didn't break
when you were being tortured.

1498
01:17:08.893 --> 01:17:11.630
Plus you had the foresight
to stick that thing up your...

1499
01:17:14.264 --> 01:17:15.331
...thing.

1500
01:17:18.703 --> 01:17:20.670
You know, I'm impressed
with you too.

1501
01:17:20.672 --> 01:17:22.505
You risked
your whole life for me.

1502
01:17:22.507 --> 01:17:24.540
Not many people
would have done that.

1503
01:17:24.542 --> 01:17:26.544
Including
my ex-boyfriend.

1504
01:17:28.947 --> 01:17:30.147
Yeah, about that.

1505
01:17:31.583 --> 01:17:32.717
I wanna clear something up.

1506
01:17:34.319 --> 01:17:36.554
You weren't just a cover
for Drew. That much I know.

1507
01:17:37.822 --> 01:17:38.623
How?

1508
01:17:40.225 --> 01:17:42.759
I was there the night
you two met. At your birthday.

1509
01:17:42.761 --> 01:17:43.860
What? At the bar?

1510
01:17:43.862 --> 01:17:45.828
Outside,
in the surveillance van.

1511
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:47.397
Drew was in the bar
to take out a target.

1512
01:17:47.399 --> 01:17:48.800
- Wait, who?
- The bartender.

1513
01:17:49.668 --> 01:17:50.935
He was a recruiter for ISIS.

1514
01:17:55.007 --> 01:17:56.875
Craft bourbon cocktail
with tobacco bitters

1515
01:17:58.710 --> 01:17:59.678
and rhubarb zest.

1516
01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:09.654
Can you identify him
as the target?

1517
01:18:16.594 --> 01:18:18.261
- Oops, I'm sorry.
- Oh, sorry!

1518
01:18:18.263 --> 01:18:19.328
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

1519
01:18:19.330 --> 01:18:21.631
No. Do not get distracted.

1520
01:18:21.633 --> 01:18:23.700
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>It's not my birthday.</i>

1521
01:18:23.702 --> 01:18:24.902
- <i>Oh.</i>
- <i>I, um...</i>

1522
01:18:24.904 --> 01:18:27.270
<i>I just kind of wear it
for warmth.</i>

1523
01:18:27.272 --> 01:18:28.604
- <i>Well, if it was your birthday...</i>
- She's funny.

1524
01:18:28.606 --> 01:18:30.306
<i>I would say "Happy birthday."</i>

1525
01:18:30.308 --> 01:18:31.911
Thayer, get away
from her now.

1526
01:18:33.813 --> 01:18:35.547
In our line of work,
being with someone,

1527
01:18:36.749 --> 01:18:37.750
caring about them,

1528
01:18:39.284 --> 01:18:41.317
it makes our job harder.

1529
01:18:41.319 --> 01:18:43.723
So if Drew was trying
with you, then...

1530
01:18:45.524 --> 01:18:46.926
That was real.

1531
01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:50.393
And not that you
asked my opinion,

1532
01:18:50.395 --> 01:18:52.295
but the worst song
on that jukebox is

1533
01:18:52.297 --> 01:18:53.466
<i>Your Body Is a Wonderland.</i>

1534
01:18:53.999 --> 01:18:54.934
No question.

1535
01:18:56.068 --> 01:18:57.568
Oh, my God! What?

1536
01:18:57.570 --> 01:19:00.003
What? No way!
Absolutely not. No.

1537
01:19:02.775 --> 01:19:04.475
Um, I lost my virginity
to that song.

1538
01:19:04.477 --> 01:19:06.443
What?

1539
01:19:06.445 --> 01:19:08.447
To who? The cheesiest
person in the world?

1540
01:19:08.814 --> 01:19:10.248
Oh!

1541
01:19:11.083 --> 01:19:13.650
Oh, hey, guys.

1542
01:19:13.652 --> 01:19:16.589
Uh, rookworst, am I right?

1543
01:19:22.995 --> 01:19:25.664
It always works.
It's actually kind of funny.

1544
01:19:28.501 --> 01:19:29.600
Audrey!

1545
01:19:29.602 --> 01:19:30.868
Oh, my God! Morgan.

1546
01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:31.837
She talks too much.

1547
01:19:33.038 --> 01:19:34.340
Duffer.

1548
01:19:37.443 --> 01:19:38.709
Jesus!

1549
01:19:38.711 --> 01:19:39.977
Oh, my God!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1550
01:19:39.979 --> 01:19:41.945
Whoa! Whoa! Hey! Move! Move!

1551
01:19:42.948 --> 01:19:44.681
Hands up.

1552
01:19:44.683 --> 01:19:45.984
- Okay.
- That's both hands, cripple.

1553
01:19:47.486 --> 01:19:49.053
Come on, Seb. Higher.

1554
01:19:50.489 --> 01:19:52.356
Just because I can.

1555
01:19:52.358 --> 01:19:54.525
What's this about,
Duffer? Revenge?

1556
01:19:54.527 --> 01:19:55.894
I was suspended. You won.

1557
01:19:55.896 --> 01:19:57.496
Come on, man. I know I won.

1558
01:19:58.865 --> 01:20:00.833
I'm just here for this.

1559
01:20:02.368 --> 01:20:05.769
Of course, now I have a few
loose ends to tie up.

1560
01:20:05.771 --> 01:20:07.404
Hey! Hey!

1561
01:20:07.406 --> 01:20:10.141
Okay! He has nothing
to do with this, okay?

1562
01:20:10.143 --> 01:20:12.143
I promise you this is
just Morgan and me.

1563
01:20:12.145 --> 01:20:13.778
Why don't you
go back to the CIA,

1564
01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:15.980
- and tell them that?
- Jesus!

1565
01:20:15.982 --> 01:20:17.782
You don't know
that I'm the bad guy?

1566
01:20:17.784 --> 01:20:18.850
What?

1567
01:20:18.852 --> 01:20:20.718
He's not here
on CIA business.

1568
01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:22.452
He's working for Highland now.

1569
01:20:22.454 --> 01:20:24.488
You have no idea
how much the Chinese mafia's

1570
01:20:24.490 --> 01:20:25.857
willing to pay for this.

1571
01:20:25.859 --> 01:20:28.660
Or the Russian mafia.
Multiple mafias want this.

1572
01:20:28.662 --> 01:20:29.861
And, on that note,

1573
01:20:29.863 --> 01:20:32.063
I'll finish you all off
and be on my way.

1574
01:20:32.065 --> 01:20:34.833
As much fun as it's been
watching you fucktards play

1575
01:20:34.835 --> 01:20:36.269
<i>Tinker Tailor Stoner Spy.</i>

1576
01:20:42.475 --> 01:20:44.943
- Okay, I got it.
- That's a joke, Audrey.

1577
01:20:44.945 --> 01:20:46.678
It's funny, because I'm funny. You
know what? It doesn't matter.

1578
01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:48.746
Because there's one thing
that's mightier than the pen,

1579
01:20:48.748 --> 01:20:50.548
and it's called
a fucking handgun!

1580
01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:52.917
- Oh, my God!
- So, for heckling me, Audrey...

1581
01:20:52.919 --> 01:20:54.185
Oh, my God. Please don't do this.
Please don't do this.

1582
01:20:54.187 --> 01:20:55.653
Duffer, don't do this.

1583
01:20:55.655 --> 01:20:57.055
- You die first.
- Duffer!

1584
01:20:57.057 --> 01:20:57.991
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1585
01:21:02.762 --> 01:21:04.729
Oh.

1586
01:21:04.731 --> 01:21:08.068
This man, he want
to rob from us, right?

1587
01:21:11.705 --> 01:21:13.872
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally.
Yes. Absolutely.

1588
01:21:13.874 --> 01:21:15.909
- Oh, my God! Really, it's scary.
- Yes.

1589
01:21:22.482 --> 01:21:23.882
How did he find us?

1590
01:21:23.884 --> 01:21:25.785
I don't know.
We took every precaution.

1591
01:21:27.121 --> 01:21:28.087
We only used cash.

1592
01:21:28.089 --> 01:21:29.389
No phones.

1593
01:21:32.893 --> 01:21:33.958
Morgan.

1594
01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:34.794
Hmm?

1595
01:21:35.595 --> 01:21:37.464
Did you call
your parents again?

1596
01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:40.932
Yes. I had to.

1597
01:21:40.934 --> 01:21:42.734
My father was gonna think
that I was dead

1598
01:21:42.736 --> 01:21:43.801
if he found out about Roger.

1599
01:21:43.803 --> 01:21:46.738
So I went to a souvenir shop,
I got a burner phone.

1600
01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:48.974
I picked it up. One second,
"Hi, I'm alive."

1601
01:21:48.976 --> 01:21:50.976
And then I threw it
in the dumpster.

1602
01:21:50.978 --> 01:21:52.912
They can't trace a call
if it's less than two minutes.

1603
01:21:52.914 --> 01:21:55.080
- That's not a thing anymore.
- That's not a thing!

1604
01:21:55.082 --> 01:21:56.614
Well, I know that now.

1605
01:21:56.616 --> 01:21:58.683
Ugh...

1606
01:21:58.685 --> 01:22:00.585
Oh, my God.
He's coming back to life.

1607
01:22:00.587 --> 01:22:01.789
He's reanimating.

1608
01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:09.194
Okay, it's a phone.
That makes more sense.

1609
01:22:09.196 --> 01:22:10.996
It needs a thumbprint.

1610
01:22:10.998 --> 01:22:12.831
- There's the thumb.
- Seriously?

1611
01:22:12.833 --> 01:22:14.434
I'm standing,
so I can't do it.

1612
01:22:15.169 --> 01:22:16.103
Oh, my God.

1613
01:22:18.105 --> 01:22:19.472
Ugh.

1614
01:22:21.008 --> 01:22:23.108
It says, "Text me
when you get the package."

1615
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:24.710
Um...

1616
01:22:24.712 --> 01:22:28.047
Tell him we have the package,
and ask where the drop is.

1617
01:22:28.049 --> 01:22:30.582
Oh, shit.
It's locked again. Hold on.

1618
01:22:30.584 --> 01:22:32.851
Oh, oh.

1619
01:22:32.853 --> 01:22:35.087
He said, "Bring it
to Operation Albrecht."

1620
01:22:35.089 --> 01:22:36.755
- Okay.
- What's Operation Albrecht?

1621
01:22:36.757 --> 01:22:37.925
I'm checking his emails.

1622
01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:40.993
Ah.

1623
01:22:40.995 --> 01:22:43.963
He's been communicating with
someone named Hunter Pierce.

1624
01:22:43.965 --> 01:22:45.130
So a gay porn star.

1625
01:22:45.132 --> 01:22:47.166
Uh...

1626
01:22:47.168 --> 01:22:49.802
Highland was planning
to buy the drive from Duffer.

1627
01:22:49.804 --> 01:22:51.472
They called it
Operation Albrecht.

1628
01:22:52.239 --> 01:22:54.006
It's going down
tomorrow night.

1629
01:22:54.008 --> 01:22:56.909
There's a gala in Berlin
at the Museum of Technology.

1630
01:22:56.911 --> 01:22:59.814
Text him back and say we'll
meet them there with the drive.

1631
01:23:02.183 --> 01:23:04.850
The phone is locked again.
I need the thumbprint.

1632
01:23:04.852 --> 01:23:06.552
You know what? Forget it.

1633
01:23:09.790 --> 01:23:11.123
- Okay.
- Oh, the thumb! Yes!

1634
01:23:11.125 --> 01:23:12.127
Audrey...

1635
01:23:14.695 --> 01:23:17.029
Oh, my God!

1636
01:23:25.307 --> 01:23:26.739
Thumbs up.

1637
01:23:26.741 --> 01:23:27.742
Go.

1638
01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:34.680
So here's the plan.
We go to Berlin.

1639
01:23:36.817 --> 01:23:38.918
<i>Wait, we're gonna walk
right into this gala?</i>

1640
01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:41.754
<i>No. We pose as
two people on the guest list.</i>

1641
01:23:41.756 --> 01:23:43.890
<i>The Canadian ambassador
and his wife.</i>

1642
01:23:43.892 --> 01:23:45.791
<i>Uh, won't people know
what they look like?</i>

1643
01:23:45.793 --> 01:23:46.926
<i>No.</i>

1644
01:23:46.928 --> 01:23:48.995
<i>No one ever remembers
what Canadians look like.</i>

1645
01:23:48.997 --> 01:23:50.832
<i>They land at Tegel Airport
at 2:00 p.m.</i>

1646
01:23:51.766 --> 01:23:53.266
<i>Can I do an accent?</i>

1647
01:23:53.268 --> 01:23:54.968
- <i>Please don't.
- I know what I'm gonna do.</i>

1648
01:23:54.970 --> 01:23:57.237
Hiya! Is you the Mullicays?

1649
01:23:57.239 --> 01:23:58.206
Perfect. I'm Bill.

1650
01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:01.074
I know what you're thinking.

1651
01:24:01.076 --> 01:24:02.842
How'd a bloke
from the East End

1652
01:24:02.844 --> 01:24:04.610
get all the way
to Berlin, Germany?

1653
01:24:04.612 --> 01:24:07.313
Well, I will tell you
on the way to the car.

1654
01:24:07.315 --> 01:24:10.750
I said, "What are you
doing here, Queen?"

1655
01:24:10.752 --> 01:24:13.653
She said, "I was
bored up in that castle.

1656
01:24:13.655 --> 01:24:14.890
"I had to get out."

1657
01:24:19.661 --> 01:24:21.263
Okay, let's drive then.

1658
01:24:23.665 --> 01:24:25.965
No! We're being robbed.

1659
01:24:25.967 --> 01:24:27.834
No! Not again.

1660
01:24:27.836 --> 01:24:31.071
- Sorry.
- Please, no. I've a little girl at home.

1661
01:24:31.073 --> 01:24:33.139
- Okay. We gotta go!
- Me wife is dead.

1662
01:24:33.141 --> 01:24:35.108
- Go. Get out. They're asleep!
- She needs a new kidney.

1663
01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:37.612
- Morgan, no, let's just...
- I came up with a story.

1664
01:25:04.673 --> 01:25:07.141
I hope I look like
the Canadian ambassador's wife.

1665
01:25:07.143 --> 01:25:09.310
I hope I look like Chris
Kirkpatrick from NSYNC.

1666
01:25:09.312 --> 01:25:11.711
- Am I done?
- Yeah. You're good.

1667
01:25:11.713 --> 01:25:13.080
I just think if one of us is
changing her look,

1668
01:25:13.082 --> 01:25:14.714
then the other
should change her look

1669
01:25:14.716 --> 01:25:15.782
for disguise reasons.

1670
01:25:15.784 --> 01:25:18.887
Like, you're about to look
like Amanda Mullicay.

1671
01:25:19.821 --> 01:25:21.090
And I'm about to look like...

1672
01:25:22.691 --> 01:25:25.259
Shit. I'm about
to look like you.

1673
01:25:25.261 --> 01:25:27.328
Not that it's a bad look.
It's just we switched places,

1674
01:25:27.330 --> 01:25:29.930
so if they're looking
for a blonde and a brunette,

1675
01:25:29.932 --> 01:25:31.731
then we're still gonna be
a blonde and a brunette.

1676
01:25:31.733 --> 01:25:32.933
Oh, we fucked up.

1677
01:25:32.935 --> 01:25:35.035
I hope this isn't
what gets us killed tonight.

1678
01:25:35.037 --> 01:25:38.472
No. Hey, we're
not gonna die tonight.

1679
01:25:38.474 --> 01:25:40.276
You're right, we're not.
But if we do...

1680
01:25:41.444 --> 01:25:43.777
- We're not, but if we do...
- Oh, my God.

1681
01:25:43.779 --> 01:25:46.380
I know a lot of horrific stuff
has happened this week,

1682
01:25:46.382 --> 01:25:47.682
but, um...

1683
01:25:49.051 --> 01:25:50.720
It has been
the best week of my life.

1684
01:25:52.188 --> 01:25:54.989
- Really?
- Yeah, just being out here, like,

1685
01:25:54.991 --> 01:25:58.225
on this adventure, with you,

1686
01:25:58.227 --> 01:26:01.028
doing the right thing,
and nobody's judging me...

1687
01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:02.165
I don't know.

1688
01:26:03.299 --> 01:26:04.700
Do you normally feel judged?

1689
01:26:05.768 --> 01:26:06.934
You know that thing
that Drew said to me

1690
01:26:06.936 --> 01:26:08.969
about me being a little much?

1691
01:26:08.971 --> 01:26:11.238
It's not the first time
I've heard that.

1692
01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:13.140
You're not "a little much."

1693
01:26:13.142 --> 01:26:15.409
I am. I am "a little much."
I'm a lot much.

1694
01:26:15.411 --> 01:26:17.512
No, you're not.

1695
01:26:17.514 --> 01:26:18.846
The only people
who don't think so

1696
01:26:18.848 --> 01:26:20.047
are you and my parents.

1697
01:26:20.049 --> 01:26:21.884
That's 'cause
everyone else is boring.

1698
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:27.190
Sorry.

1699
01:26:29.493 --> 01:26:31.225
I'm so proud of you.

1700
01:26:31.227 --> 01:26:32.527
Honey, I'm proud of you.

1701
01:26:34.931 --> 01:26:35.932
Oh, my God.

1702
01:26:38.935 --> 01:26:40.368
- So, don't...
- Don't die, okay?

1703
01:26:40.370 --> 01:26:42.437
Please don't die,
because then I would die,

1704
01:26:42.439 --> 01:26:45.273
and then we would both be dead,
and that would be a waste.

1705
01:27:00.056 --> 01:27:02.424
Morgan.
Are you in position?

1706
01:27:02.426 --> 01:27:04.125
Yeah, I was born in position.

1707
01:27:04.127 --> 01:27:06.194
Yes, everyone's
born in position.

1708
01:27:06.196 --> 01:27:08.363
That's why they call it
the fetal position.

1709
01:27:08.365 --> 01:27:09.930
Right. Yeah, I just got that.

1710
01:27:11.435 --> 01:27:14.336
- Amanda.
- Ethan.

1711
01:27:14.338 --> 01:27:17.007
Just act natural.
Just another normal night.

1712
01:27:18.808 --> 01:27:20.108
Yeah.

1713
01:27:20.110 --> 01:27:21.309
<i>Performing with
Cirque du Soleil</i>

1714
01:27:21.311 --> 01:27:23.178
<i>is actually a top three
dream of mine.</i>

1715
01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:24.279
I'm highly prepared
for this mission.

1716
01:27:24.281 --> 01:27:27.415
I was a C.I.T. in Acrobatics
and Clowning at camp.

1717
01:27:27.417 --> 01:27:29.417
It was competitive
and I excelled.

1718
01:27:29.419 --> 01:27:31.586
Once again, Morgan, you're not
performing with the troupe.

1719
01:27:31.588 --> 01:27:34.589
Your job is to stay backstage
and watch the surveillance.

1720
01:27:34.591 --> 01:27:36.091
<i>We need to locate the buyer.</i>

1721
01:27:36.093 --> 01:27:37.361
Okay. But... But...

1722
01:27:38.595 --> 01:27:40.962
Not just for one song?

1723
01:27:40.964 --> 01:27:42.097
- <i>No.</i>
- I hear you.

1724
01:27:42.099 --> 01:27:44.165
But wouldn't I be better able
to identify the mark

1725
01:27:44.167 --> 01:27:46.134
if I was spinning around on
that silver spinning thingy?

1726
01:27:46.136 --> 01:27:47.469
- <i>No.</i>
- Copy that.

1727
01:27:47.471 --> 01:27:49.104
But what if
I was on the trapeze?

1728
01:27:49.106 --> 01:27:51.039
In which I am trained.

1729
01:27:51.041 --> 01:27:52.841
- No.
- <i>Affirmative.</i>

1730
01:27:52.843 --> 01:27:53.777
Mongoose standing down.

1731
01:27:56.380 --> 01:27:57.846
Hey!

1732
01:28:04.021 --> 01:28:05.253
Hey!

1733
01:28:08.626 --> 01:28:11.126
<i>You guys, you guys,
I see someone suspicious.</i>

1734
01:28:11.128 --> 01:28:13.862
Okay. Stay calm.

1735
01:28:13.864 --> 01:28:16.164
- <i>Can you describe them?</i>
- Okay.

1736
01:28:16.166 --> 01:28:18.233
He's got an insane
twirly mustache.

1737
01:28:18.235 --> 01:28:19.901
<i>He's got the big bushy
scary eyebrows.</i>

1738
01:28:19.903 --> 01:28:21.004
And...

1739
01:28:22.172 --> 01:28:24.340
Yep. Yep.
He's holding a bag of money.

1740
01:28:24.342 --> 01:28:26.509
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we have our buyer.</i>

1741
01:28:26.511 --> 01:28:28.311
Yeah, I think that guy's
part of the show.

1742
01:28:28.313 --> 01:28:30.178
Yeah, Morgan, I don't think
an actual bad guy

1743
01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:32.013
would look like
an evil Mr. Monopoly.

1744
01:28:32.015 --> 01:28:33.349
<i>I don't know.</i>

1745
01:28:33.351 --> 01:28:35.484
I gotta go with my gut
on this. I'm sorry.

1746
01:28:38.489 --> 01:28:39.524
Oh.

1747
01:28:54.938 --> 01:28:57.173
And I was mistaken.
He is a part of the show.

1748
01:28:57.175 --> 01:28:59.277
I repeat,
he is a part of the show.

1749
01:29:00.511 --> 01:29:03.112
Oh!

1750
01:29:06.117 --> 01:29:08.484
- What?
- That's Tom and Marsha.

1751
01:29:08.486 --> 01:29:10.621
Drew's fake parents.
Or whoever they are.

1752
01:29:20.231 --> 01:29:23.065
Morgan, get backstage.
I've been blown.

1753
01:29:25.503 --> 01:29:26.371
Who has blown you?

1754
01:29:27.238 --> 01:29:28.571
Morgan, it's not funny.

1755
01:29:28.573 --> 01:29:32.074
<i>I agree. There's nothing funny
about you being blown.</i>

1756
01:29:32.076 --> 01:29:33.376
<i>Okay. You two, stay together</i>

1757
01:29:33.378 --> 01:29:34.577
and in plain sight
until I get back.

1758
01:29:34.579 --> 01:29:36.314
You, uh... You put the drive
somewhere safe?

1759
01:29:37.248 --> 01:29:38.614
Very safe.

1760
01:29:38.616 --> 01:29:40.218
Is it the same place
as last time?

1761
01:29:40.585 --> 01:29:41.986
You'll see.

1762
01:29:43.955 --> 01:29:45.490
I don't actually mean,
like, you'll see.

1763
01:29:47.125 --> 01:29:48.124
- Please just go.
- Yeah.

1764
01:29:48.126 --> 01:29:49.225
Okay.

1765
01:30:04.075 --> 01:30:05.176
No smoking, sir.

1766
01:30:05.511 --> 01:30:07.076
Oh.

1767
01:30:07.078 --> 01:30:08.946
I'm sorry.
Awful habit, I know.

1768
01:30:10.549 --> 01:30:12.148
- You want one?
- I don't smoke, sir.

1769
01:30:12.150 --> 01:30:13.249
Yeah, neither do I.

1770
01:30:36.575 --> 01:30:37.376
Sebastian...

1771
01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:40.279
Sebastian, you got a text.

1772
01:30:44.048 --> 01:30:45.384
Sebastian, is everything okay?

1773
01:31:16.348 --> 01:31:18.148
Morgan, Sebastian's
not responding.

1774
01:31:18.150 --> 01:31:19.817
<i>Oh, my God!
That's really bad.</i>

1775
01:31:19.819 --> 01:31:22.185
Or not. I don't wanna scare
you. Could mean anything.

1776
01:31:22.187 --> 01:31:24.421
The buyer texted me.
I have to go meet him.

1777
01:31:24.423 --> 01:31:26.590
- Or her.
- <i>Thank you. I was gonna say,</i>

1778
01:31:26.592 --> 01:31:28.425
women can be terrorists too.

1779
01:31:28.427 --> 01:31:30.360
<i>We can do anything
we put our minds to.</i>

1780
01:31:30.362 --> 01:31:31.394
Can you see if you can
get eyes on Sebastian?

1781
01:31:31.396 --> 01:31:32.663
He couldn't have gotten far.

1782
01:31:32.665 --> 01:31:33.700
Okay.

1783
01:31:36.201 --> 01:31:37.467
Yeah. In that case,

1784
01:31:37.469 --> 01:31:39.369
I am gonna climb
the ladder. I know...

1785
01:31:40.773 --> 01:31:41.906
Morgan?

1786
01:31:41.908 --> 01:31:44.609
...trapeze platform really
is the best vantage point.

1787
01:31:44.611 --> 01:31:46.243
Morgan!

1788
01:31:46.245 --> 01:31:47.379
Oh, my God.

1789
01:32:06.799 --> 01:32:08.033
Audrey. Oh, my God!

1790
01:32:08.468 --> 01:32:09.669
What the fuck?

1791
01:32:11.371 --> 01:32:12.539
Okay.

1792
01:32:13.706 --> 01:32:14.839
Okay.

1793
01:32:17.142 --> 01:32:19.243
Audrey, the goldfinch
has reached

1794
01:32:19.245 --> 01:32:21.111
her very precarious perch.

1795
01:32:21.113 --> 01:32:22.880
I think I'm about,
I don't know,

1796
01:32:22.882 --> 01:32:24.517
2,000 feet off the ground.

1797
01:32:25.652 --> 01:32:26.653
Huh.

1798
01:32:30.490 --> 01:32:31.491
No.

1799
01:32:38.298 --> 01:32:40.433
Okay. I'm gonna go. Wait.

1800
01:32:41.434 --> 01:32:42.602
What? Excuse me.

1801
01:32:43.336 --> 01:32:44.504
Give me the ladder.

1802
01:32:45.405 --> 01:32:46.470
Fuck me.

1803
01:32:48.675 --> 01:32:50.908
- Drew, you're supposed to be dead.
- Dead. Yeah.

1804
01:32:50.910 --> 01:32:53.311
I was right on the edge.

1805
01:32:53.313 --> 01:32:55.682
But the idea of you being
out there kept me alive.

1806
01:32:56.917 --> 01:32:58.251
I'm here to save you.

1807
01:32:59.352 --> 01:33:01.452
- Me?
- And to stop Henshaw.

1808
01:33:01.454 --> 01:33:03.623
What? Sebastian?
No, he's helping us.

1809
01:33:04.624 --> 01:33:06.459
Audrey, do you know
about Highland?

1810
01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:09.460
Yeah.

1811
01:33:09.462 --> 01:33:10.697
Sebastian works for Highland.

1812
01:33:13.266 --> 01:33:14.632
No. That's not possible.

1813
01:33:14.634 --> 01:33:16.367
Why would he come
and risk his life?

1814
01:33:16.369 --> 01:33:17.668
Why would he get fired?

1815
01:33:17.670 --> 01:33:19.203
What did he tell you?
Did he tell you

1816
01:33:19.205 --> 01:33:21.272
you're here to find
a buyer for the drive?

1817
01:33:21.274 --> 01:33:23.207
You're just here
so he can kill me.

1818
01:33:23.209 --> 01:33:25.278
He was using you
as bait to find me.

1819
01:33:26.379 --> 01:33:27.781
He knew that
I'd come back for you.

1820
01:33:28.949 --> 01:33:30.516
That I'd never
let him hurt you.

1821
01:33:31.785 --> 01:33:32.586
And now, here I am.

1822
01:33:33.954 --> 01:33:35.854
Yeah.

1823
01:33:35.856 --> 01:33:37.856
Audrey, I have some bad news.

1824
01:33:37.858 --> 01:33:40.525
Nadedja is still alive,

1825
01:33:40.527 --> 01:33:42.928
and she is on the other
trapeze platform

1826
01:33:42.930 --> 01:33:44.496
right now.

1827
01:33:44.498 --> 01:33:45.897
She might have a bomb on her.
I don't know.

1828
01:33:45.899 --> 01:33:48.232
Maybe this is one
of the terrorist attacks.

1829
01:33:48.234 --> 01:33:49.166
That doesn't really
make any sense.

1830
01:33:49.168 --> 01:33:51.335
She doesn't seem
like a suicide bomber.

1831
01:33:51.337 --> 01:33:53.572
That girl has
high self-esteem.

1832
01:33:53.574 --> 01:33:54.775
She's so full of herself.

1833
01:33:57.344 --> 01:33:59.511
The point is, Audrey,
I'm looking at her,

1834
01:33:59.513 --> 01:34:01.980
and she definitely
does wanna kill me.

1835
01:34:01.982 --> 01:34:03.849
And then she's gonna
come after you.

1836
01:34:06.253 --> 01:34:08.722
So I think I gotta fix this.

1837
01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:14.528
I can do this.

1838
01:34:15.362 --> 01:34:17.262
Remember your training

1839
01:34:17.264 --> 01:34:18.565
from the New Jersey
Circus Center.

1840
01:34:58.873 --> 01:35:00.639
Could I just
ask you something?

1841
01:35:00.641 --> 01:35:01.709
Anything.

1842
01:35:03.544 --> 01:35:04.877
Did you leave that drive
in my apartment

1843
01:35:04.879 --> 01:35:07.612
because you thought
that I would never leave?

1844
01:35:07.614 --> 01:35:10.717
That I wouldn't grow?
That I wouldn't go anywhere?

1845
01:35:10.719 --> 01:35:12.785
Did you send me to Vienna
because you just

1846
01:35:12.787 --> 01:35:14.486
assumed that I wouldn't
question anything?

1847
01:35:14.488 --> 01:35:16.256
No. No. No, no. I mean...

1848
01:35:18.559 --> 01:35:19.627
I underestimated you.

1849
01:35:20.762 --> 01:35:21.896
You hurt me.

1850
01:35:24.032 --> 01:35:25.466
I'm so sorry.

1851
01:35:27.001 --> 01:35:27.936
I had to.

1852
01:35:29.904 --> 01:35:31.806
But now, seeing everything
that you've done,

1853
01:35:34.374 --> 01:35:35.643
I've never loved you more.

1854
01:35:38.345 --> 01:35:39.246
Do you love me?

1855
01:35:39.914 --> 01:35:41.583
I love you, Audrey Stockman.

1856
01:35:49.624 --> 01:35:50.658
Looks very real to me.

1857
01:35:56.798 --> 01:35:59.799
What was the name
of the nun that beat you

1858
01:35:59.801 --> 01:36:02.635
in whatever fucking orphanage...

1859
01:36:02.637 --> 01:36:04.437
...you grew up in,
you skank?

1860
01:36:04.439 --> 01:36:05.774
Ow. Ow.

1861
01:37:20.883 --> 01:37:24.086
Audrey.
Audrey, I did it.

1862
01:37:25.754 --> 01:37:26.822
We're safe.

1863
01:37:28.858 --> 01:37:29.859
Audrey.

1864
01:37:31.594 --> 01:37:32.728
Audrey?

1865
01:37:34.930 --> 01:37:35.931
Shit!

1866
01:37:37.499 --> 01:37:39.068
Your boss give you
any new spy gadgets?

1867
01:37:39.869 --> 01:37:40.703
Uh, no.

1868
01:37:41.604 --> 01:37:42.769
Canadian now?

1869
01:37:42.771 --> 01:37:45.906
- Eh!
- Eh! Good.

1870
01:37:45.908 --> 01:37:49.712
- Oh, um... I wouldn't open that.
- Is that gonna blow my head off?

1871
01:37:50.079 --> 01:37:51.912
Hmm?

1872
01:37:51.914 --> 01:37:54.448
Thousand guesses, never
would've landed on "thumb."

1873
01:37:55.951 --> 01:37:57.453
Anything else, Double O Sexy?

1874
01:38:01.924 --> 01:38:03.025
The drive isn't in there.

1875
01:38:06.762 --> 01:38:07.763
Oh, come on.

1876
01:38:10.532 --> 01:38:11.700
Hey.

1877
01:38:12.601 --> 01:38:13.903
You can trust me.

1878
01:38:15.905 --> 01:38:18.974
Really? 'Cause you said
not to trust anyone.

1879
01:38:22.112 --> 01:38:23.777
- Stand back!
- Go on. Move it.

1880
01:38:23.779 --> 01:38:25.179
Sebastian?

1881
01:38:25.181 --> 01:38:27.583
- Audrey.
- Audrey, step back. He's with them.

1882
01:38:28.517 --> 01:38:29.984
- Thayer?
- Hey, bro.

1883
01:38:29.986 --> 01:38:31.652
Audrey, step away from him.

1884
01:38:31.654 --> 01:38:33.620
He's gonna kill all of us.

1885
01:38:33.622 --> 01:38:35.058
He said the same thing
about you.

1886
01:38:39.996 --> 01:38:40.797
Hello.

1887
01:38:43.099 --> 01:38:45.133
Thayer,
remove the target.

1888
01:38:45.135 --> 01:38:46.267
Fuck you, Dad.

1889
01:38:49.739 --> 01:38:50.805
Mom.

1890
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:55.977
Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait!
Wait! Hold on. Hold on.

1891
01:38:55.979 --> 01:38:59.481
Audrey, listen to me. Drew
is working with Highland.

1892
01:39:00.684 --> 01:39:01.950
Sebastian was working
with Highland.

1893
01:39:01.952 --> 01:39:03.051
That's a lie.

1894
01:39:03.053 --> 01:39:04.886
Audrey, he was working
with Duffer too.

1895
01:39:04.888 --> 01:39:06.321
Sebastian was
working with Duffer.

1896
01:39:06.323 --> 01:39:09.023
Drew's the one that sent
the assassin to the gymnasium.

1897
01:39:09.025 --> 01:39:10.091
He would've let you die.

1898
01:39:10.093 --> 01:39:12.694
Sebastian sent the
assassin to the gymnasium.

1899
01:39:12.696 --> 01:39:13.828
Sebastian would've let you die.

1900
01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:15.763
Okay, everything I say you did
you can't just say I did.

1901
01:39:15.765 --> 01:39:17.231
I can 'cause
I've got the gun.

1902
01:39:29.145 --> 01:39:30.311
You okay?

1903
01:39:30.313 --> 01:39:31.713
I'm so scared.

1904
01:39:31.715 --> 01:39:32.849
It's all right. It's okay.

1905
01:39:37.220 --> 01:39:40.088
I'm so sorry
I dragged you into this.

1906
01:39:40.090 --> 01:39:41.224
- It's okay. It's okay.
- I know.

1907
01:39:42.792 --> 01:39:44.559
Can we please just go home?

1908
01:39:44.561 --> 01:39:45.660
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1909
01:39:45.662 --> 01:39:46.997
I'm gonna take care of you.

1910
01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:53.670
You looking for this?

1911
01:39:56.072 --> 01:39:56.873
Uh, Audrey, that's...

1912
01:39:59.276 --> 01:40:01.343
That's cute, but I don't think
you know what you're doing.

1913
01:40:01.345 --> 01:40:03.745
God, you really do
still underestimate me.

1914
01:40:03.747 --> 01:40:05.082
Audrey, come on.

1915
01:40:07.084 --> 01:40:08.183
Audrey...

1916
01:40:09.686 --> 01:40:11.554
Get off me! No!

1917
01:40:16.726 --> 01:40:17.825
Oh, my God!

1918
01:40:17.827 --> 01:40:20.661
Oh, Morgan.
Always so dramatic.

1919
01:40:22.299 --> 01:40:23.167
Fuck!

1920
01:40:24.001 --> 01:40:25.167
Oh, God!

1921
01:40:26.603 --> 01:40:27.938
Argh!

1922
01:40:35.913 --> 01:40:36.947
You better hurry.

1923
01:40:38.015 --> 01:40:38.916
Finish me off.

1924
01:40:41.285 --> 01:40:42.585
Oh, that's right.

1925
01:40:43.287 --> 01:40:44.953
You never finish anything.

1926
01:40:46.857 --> 01:40:48.092
To quote a text I got,

1927
01:40:49.693 --> 01:40:53.796
"Hey there.
It's over. Sorry."

1928
01:40:53.798 --> 01:40:55.264
Audrey... Audrey, don't.

1929
01:40:59.804 --> 01:41:00.971
I lied.

1930
01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:10.979
Drew Thayer, don't move.

1931
01:41:10.981 --> 01:41:12.083
You're under arrest.

1932
01:41:15.319 --> 01:41:17.686
<i>We
have apprehended Drew Thayer.</i>

1933
01:41:17.688 --> 01:41:19.590
It's a little much,
don't you think?

1934
01:41:20.925 --> 01:41:23.125
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

1935
01:41:23.127 --> 01:41:24.962
- I'm okay. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1936
01:41:27.898 --> 01:41:29.264
Sebastian?

1937
01:41:36.173 --> 01:41:38.006
What the fuck?

1938
01:41:38.008 --> 01:41:40.310
Okay, these vests,
they save your life,

1939
01:41:40.312 --> 01:41:42.678
but they do not prevent you
from breaking ribs.

1940
01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:43.979
You're alive.

1941
01:41:47.084 --> 01:41:48.384
Oh, you're alive.

1942
01:42:00.031 --> 01:42:01.998
What is
the Heimlich maneuver?

1943
01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.899
<i>What is
the Heimlich maneuver?</i>

1944
01:42:03.901 --> 01:42:05.435
- <i>That's it.</i>
- <i>Instruments for eight.</i>

1945
01:42:05.437 --> 01:42:06.970
<i>This long, powerful horn...</i>

1946
01:42:06.972 --> 01:42:08.338
That's a long number.

1947
01:42:08.340 --> 01:42:09.339
Oh.

1948
01:42:09.341 --> 01:42:10.873
Hello.

1949
01:42:10.875 --> 01:42:13.209
- Mom, I'm alive.
- <i>Honey, are you okay?</i>

1950
01:42:13.211 --> 01:42:14.377
Let me turn this down.

1951
01:42:14.379 --> 01:42:15.644
Yeah, I'm gonna
put you on speaker.

1952
01:42:15.646 --> 01:42:17.147
- Hold on.
- <i>Let me turn the volume down.</i>

1953
01:42:17.149 --> 01:42:19.482
- Put in... Do... Um...
- <i>Trying to lower the volume, sweetie,</i>

1954
01:42:19.484 --> 01:42:21.851
- and I can't.
- Input.

1955
01:42:21.853 --> 01:42:22.886
Input?
I don't see input.

1956
01:42:22.888 --> 01:42:23.987
<i>Sorry, I'm calling</i>

1957
01:42:23.989 --> 01:42:25.922
from an international
spy's phone.

1958
01:42:25.924 --> 01:42:27.757
Spy. Who's a spy?

1959
01:42:27.759 --> 01:42:28.992
Yeah, input's
doing nothing.

1960
01:42:28.994 --> 01:42:31.094
He's an international spy,

1961
01:42:31.096 --> 01:42:34.397
and his name is
Sebastian Henshaw.

1962
01:42:34.399 --> 01:42:36.399
He works for MI6.

1963
01:42:36.401 --> 01:42:37.901
Morgan...

1964
01:42:37.903 --> 01:42:41.037
Can she not reveal
my identity?

1965
01:42:41.039 --> 01:42:43.039
Uh, yeah,
she tells them everything.

1966
01:42:43.041 --> 01:42:44.941
Hold on.
I have a call waiting.

1967
01:42:44.943 --> 01:42:46.144
I love you.

1968
01:42:49.948 --> 01:42:54.150
Sebastian Henshaw's phone.
This is Morgan speaking.

1969
01:42:54.152 --> 01:42:55.020
<i>Where's Henshaw?</i>

1970
01:42:56.321 --> 01:42:58.922
Oh, my God.
Is this who I think it is?

1971
01:42:58.924 --> 01:43:01.525
How could I possibly know
who you think this is?

1972
01:43:01.527 --> 01:43:04.194
<i>Oh, my God.
It is you. Wow.</i>

1973
01:43:04.196 --> 01:43:06.396
I'm letting
Audrey and Sebastian

1974
01:43:06.398 --> 01:43:08.399
have a little bit
of a moment right now.

1975
01:43:08.401 --> 01:43:10.233
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

1976
01:43:10.235 --> 01:43:11.901
- Tell him to call me back.
- <i>No, no. It's okay.</i>

1977
01:43:11.903 --> 01:43:15.406
I think I've proven myself
a trustworthy junior agent.

1978
01:43:15.408 --> 01:43:16.906
<i>Why don't you give me
the message, yeah?</i>

1979
01:43:16.908 --> 01:43:18.808
- Okay.
- Okay.

1980
01:43:18.810 --> 01:43:20.411
<i>You may tell him this,</i>

1981
01:43:20.413 --> 01:43:22.845
that he can come back
to the office on Monday.

1982
01:43:22.847 --> 01:43:25.549
Really? Oh, my gosh!
That's the best.

1983
01:43:25.551 --> 01:43:26.816
- Thank you.
- <i>He's gonna be so happy.</i>

1984
01:43:26.818 --> 01:43:28.151
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

1985
01:43:28.153 --> 01:43:31.054
Mon... Oh! Monday is
tough for me though.

1986
01:43:31.056 --> 01:43:32.323
- <i>Okay.</i>
- No, no, no.

1987
01:43:32.325 --> 01:43:33.990
I have a callback
for a Progresso commercial.

1988
01:43:33.992 --> 01:43:36.560
But you know what? Fuck it!

1989
01:43:36.562 --> 01:43:38.429
- <i>I'm gonna cancel it.</i>
- I'm not talking about you, Morgan.

1990
01:43:38.431 --> 01:43:40.264
- Do not show up on Monday.
- <i>Okay.</i>

1991
01:43:40.266 --> 01:43:44.235
I won't come in on Monday. Gosh, I
wouldn't dream of it.

1992
01:43:44.237 --> 01:43:45.569
Great. Thank you.

1993
01:43:45.571 --> 01:43:47.371
<i>No, but I will.
I'll see you Monday.</i>

1994
01:43:47.373 --> 01:43:48.972
What do you like
in your coffee?

1995
01:43:48.974 --> 01:43:50.140
So when people ask you

1996
01:43:50.142 --> 01:43:52.343
about your first trip
to Europe...

1997
01:43:52.345 --> 01:43:55.012
I'm gonna have to tell them the truth.

1998
01:43:55.014 --> 01:43:56.748
It definitely wasn't boring.

1999
01:43:57.416 --> 01:43:58.217
No.

2000
01:44:02.355 --> 01:44:05.992
But I didn't get to do
everything that I wanted to do.

2001
01:44:07.093 --> 01:44:09.028
Oh, yeah?
What did you forget?

2002
01:44:15.001 --> 01:44:17.234
No. No, no.

2003
01:44:17.236 --> 01:44:19.136
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry. I
thought that you and I maybe...

2004
01:44:19.138 --> 01:44:20.471
- No. Actually it was...
- I'm sorry.

2005
01:44:20.473 --> 01:44:21.972
- I was going for the...
- I mean, it was the physical

2006
01:44:21.974 --> 01:44:24.243
- pain of my chest.
- Okay, then suck it up.

2007
01:44:45.464 --> 01:44:46.997
Hey.

2008
01:44:46.999 --> 01:44:48.465
All for this happening.
Love this.

2009
01:44:48.467 --> 01:44:49.900
I'm sorry to interrupt.

2010
01:44:49.902 --> 01:44:51.435
I just talked
to the MI6 lady,

2011
01:44:51.437 --> 01:44:54.138
and she said that you would
know what to do with the drive?

2012
01:44:54.140 --> 01:44:56.040
I have it this time.

2013
01:44:56.042 --> 01:44:58.008
You told us to keep it
somewhere safe.

2014
01:44:58.010 --> 01:45:00.313
Right. So I finally
swallowed it.

2015
01:45:01.213 --> 01:45:03.347
Big personal
victory of mine.

2016
01:45:03.349 --> 01:45:06.016
Well, we need to destroy it.

2017
01:45:06.018 --> 01:45:07.887
Yeah. As soon as she clears.

2018
01:45:09.188 --> 01:45:10.254
You know what I mean?

2019
01:45:11.491 --> 01:45:14.328
I, um... I should
speak to my boss.

2020
01:45:15.395 --> 01:45:17.096
Yep. Bye now.

2021
01:45:19.533 --> 01:45:21.333
Ahhh!

2022
01:45:24.937 --> 01:45:27.507
What? Okay!
Okay!

2023
01:45:29.075 --> 01:45:31.543
Yes, yes, yes!
Yes, yes, yes!

2024
01:46:08.715 --> 01:46:10.148
Happy birthday!

2025
01:46:11.418 --> 01:46:12.586
Okay. Blow, baby, blow!

2026
01:46:15.455 --> 01:46:17.655
Well, I hope your wish was
to be entertained.

2027
01:46:19.526 --> 01:46:21.561
Whoa! Guys, guys, guys!
It's just a microphone.

2028
01:46:22.629 --> 01:46:25.597
Although, fair warning.

2029
01:46:25.599 --> 01:46:28.435
<i>You may be blown away.
Two, three, four, hit it.</i>

2030
01:46:30.605 --> 01:46:35.006
<i>Audrey, it's so good to be
here with you in Tokyo,</i>

2031
01:46:35.008 --> 01:46:37.342
<i>my steamy little eda-mommy.</i>

2032
01:46:37.344 --> 01:46:40.145
<i>I have loved you
since the udon of time.</i>

2033
01:46:40.147 --> 01:46:42.981
<i>It's Japanese food puns.
That's the entertainment.</i>

2034
01:46:42.983 --> 01:46:45.718
<i>I'm going to sashimi</i>

2035
01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:48.355
<i>over here to these
very handsome ramen.</i>

2036
01:46:49.289 --> 01:46:50.756
<i>Do you like my food puns?</i>

2037
01:46:50.758 --> 01:46:52.658
<i>Or do you think
they're teri-yucky?</i>

2038
01:46:52.660 --> 01:46:54.294
<i>Audrey, I love you so much.</i>

2039
01:46:55.162 --> 01:46:55.962
<i>Happy birthday, baby.</i>

2040
01:46:57.297 --> 01:46:59.266
Morgan!

2041
01:47:00.368 --> 01:47:02.601
You shouldn't have!

2042
01:47:02.603 --> 01:47:04.004
- <i>And yet I did.</i>
- Oh.

2043
01:47:05.172 --> 01:47:06.472
Okay, Morgan. It's time.

2044
01:47:06.474 --> 01:47:08.376
<i>Shumai, my, my! Look at you.</i>

2045
01:47:09.477 --> 01:47:11.277
<i>Let's do a little
call-and-response</i>

2046
01:47:11.279 --> 01:47:13.379
<i>for Audrey's birthday,
shall we?</i>

2047
01:47:13.381 --> 01:47:16.749
<i>When I say "happy,"
you say "birthday." Happy...</i>

2048
01:47:16.751 --> 01:47:18.016
<i>Happy...</i>

2049
01:47:18.018 --> 01:47:18.717
<i>Audrey,</i>

2050
01:47:18.719 --> 01:47:20.118
happy birthday.

2051
01:48:48.510 --> 01:48:52.144
<i>I have known Audrey
for maybe 15 years,</i>

2052
01:48:52.146 --> 01:48:55.114
<i>and, in that time, she has
stayed exactly the same.</i>

2053
01:48:55.116 --> 01:48:57.617
<i>She has not changed one bit,
and so, I think,</i>

2054
01:48:57.619 --> 01:48:59.786
<i>I kind of know her
like the back of my hand,</i>

2055
01:48:59.788 --> 01:49:02.154
<i>and she's
a very simple person.</i>

2056
01:49:02.156 --> 01:49:04.691
<i>And she just doesn't really
have the mental capacity</i>

2057
01:49:04.693 --> 01:49:06.826
<i>to carry out something
like this, I don't think.</i>

2058
01:49:06.828 --> 01:49:08.095
<i>She's a dear friend.</i>

2059
01:49:09.498 --> 01:49:11.565
- <i>They said something about, like...</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

2060
01:49:11.567 --> 01:49:13.600
<i>They were doing this
for a guy or something.</i>

2061
01:49:13.602 --> 01:49:15.869
<i>Oh, yeah. Like someone died
in front of them or something.</i>

2062
01:49:15.871 --> 01:49:18.138
<i>Like, one of their
boyfriends or something.</i>

2063
01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:20.807
<i>I don't know. It was for love.
I don't know.</i>

2064
01:49:20.809 --> 01:49:23.143
<i>Looking in the mirror
and seeing the face</i>

2065
01:49:23.145 --> 01:49:24.580
<i>of somebody
who was friends with her</i>

2066
01:49:25.414 --> 01:49:27.014
<i>has been really tough.</i>

2067
01:49:27.016 --> 01:49:30.417
<i>And I think we all have to remember the
real victims in situations like this</i>

2068
01:49:30.419 --> 01:49:32.419
<i>are the friends.</i>

2069
01:49:32.421 --> 01:49:35.288
<i>Are the childhood friends
who were there from day one.</i>

2070
01:49:35.290 --> 01:49:37.357
<i>Who have to carry this burden.</i>

2071
01:49:37.359 --> 01:49:38.594
<i>And will have to carry...</i>
<i>Sorry.</i>

2072
01:49:40.596 --> 01:49:42.329
<i>And will have
to carry this burden</i>

2073
01:49:42.331 --> 01:49:43.498
<i>for a long time to come.</i>

2074
01:49:44.934 --> 01:49:46.901
<i>If you could
speak to them right now,</i>

2075
01:49:46.903 --> 01:49:48.535
<i>what would
you say to them?</i>

2076
01:49:48.537 --> 01:49:50.303
<i>Oh! Give 'em
a piece of my mind.</i>

2077
01:49:50.305 --> 01:49:51.504
<i>I want
my bum bag back.</i>

2078
01:49:51.506 --> 01:49:53.340
<i>Give me my bum bag back
for starters.</i>

2079
01:49:53.342 --> 01:49:54.942
<i>My passport,
my money.</i>

2080
01:49:54.944 --> 01:49:58.211
- <i>Yeah.</i> -<i>My lip gloss,
my keys, my phone.</i>

2081
01:49:58.213 --> 01:50:00.115
- <i>Everything.</i>
- <i>They just took everything.</i>

2082
01:50:01.550 --> 01:50:04.317
<i>I don't think
that Audrey did do this,</i>

2083
01:50:04.319 --> 01:50:06.188
<i>but, Audrey,
if you did do this,</i>

2084
01:50:08.625 --> 01:50:09.626
<i>I forgive you.</i>

2085
01:50:11.728 --> 01:50:13.694
<i>If anyone else
back in Australia is watching</i>

2086
01:50:13.696 --> 01:50:15.362
<i>you right now, what do
you wanna say to them?</i>

2087
01:50:15.364 --> 01:50:18.198
- <i>We're having such a good time!</i>
- <i>Such a good time!</i>

2088
01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:20.469
<i>Hi!</i>
<i>We're on TV!</i>

2089
01:50:20.806 --> 01:50:25.806
