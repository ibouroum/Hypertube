00:01:40.436 --> 00:01:42.798
Huh? Oh!

3
00:01:56.516 --> 00:01:57.571
Ooh!

4
00:04:24.661 --> 00:04:26.125
Nearly there, Hognob.

5
00:04:26.127 --> 00:04:28.806
Nearly there.
Just a bit farther.

6
00:04:30.367 --> 00:04:31.802
Try a little bit harder.

7
00:04:33.492 --> 00:04:34.576
We can do it.

8
00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:38.272
Just a little bit more, Hognob.

9
00:04:41.271 --> 00:04:43.152
I can reach it.

10
00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:49.889
Got it.

11
00:04:51.918 --> 00:04:54.469
Still got it.

12
00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:06.358
Hognob, enough!

13
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.986
Oi, enough now!

14
00:05:12.331 --> 00:05:15.743
Mammoths! Come on, Hognob.
Let's go wake Bobnar.

15
00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:17.402
Hey, Chief.

16
00:05:22.788 --> 00:05:23.788
Chief!

17
00:05:24.668 --> 00:05:26.166
What? What? What?

18
00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:28.973
Are you awake, Chief?

19
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.542
Chief?

20
00:05:32.544 --> 00:05:34.071
Time to go hunting.

21
00:05:34.073 --> 00:05:35.792
Bit early, isn't it, Dug?

22
00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:38.279
But, Chief, we're early man.

23
00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:42.934
Come on, everyone.

24
00:05:42.936 --> 00:05:44.181
Time to get up.

25
00:05:59.608 --> 00:06:01.010
Morning, everyone.

26
00:06:01.012 --> 00:06:03.943
Morning, Chief.

27
00:06:03.945 --> 00:06:05.856
Bit nippy this morning.

28
00:06:05.858 --> 00:06:06.909
Ow! Ow!

29
00:06:08.216 --> 00:06:09.330
Ow!

30
00:06:10.607 --> 00:06:11.607
Oops. Sorry.

31
00:06:14.242 --> 00:06:15.518
Wait, Chief. Chief...

32
00:06:17.748 --> 00:06:19.084
Chief.

33
00:06:19.086 --> 00:06:20.616
So I've been thinking.

34
00:06:20.618 --> 00:06:22.497
You know we always hunt rabbits?

35
00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:25.462
Yeah. Very tasty they are, too.

36
00:06:25.464 --> 00:06:28.648
Yes, but couldn't we
try hunting something,

37
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.423
well, you know, bigger?

38
00:06:31.425 --> 00:06:33.558
What, like a hare?

39
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.236
No, like a buffalo or a mammoth.

40
00:06:39.075 --> 00:06:44.590
You want us to hunt a
five-ton, bone-crushing mammoth?

41
00:06:44.591 --> 00:06:46.121
Yeah. Why not?

42
00:06:47.682 --> 00:06:50.263
I really believe
we could do it, Chief.

43
00:06:50.265 --> 00:06:53.259
Dug, look at our ancestors.

44
00:06:53.261 --> 00:06:56.353
You don't see them
hunting big things, do you?

45
00:06:56.355 --> 00:06:58.555
They hunted little round beasts.

46
00:06:59.988 --> 00:07:01.932
Of some sort.

47
00:07:01.933 --> 00:07:04.704
Yeah, what are
those things anyway?

48
00:07:04.706 --> 00:07:05.756
Don't know.

49
00:07:05.758 --> 00:07:07.894
I suppose they couldn't
draw rabbits back then.

50
00:07:16.724 --> 00:07:18.254
Wait. Sorry, no, Chief.

51
00:07:18.256 --> 00:07:19.975
Chief,

52
00:07:19.977 --> 00:07:21.282
about the mammoth thing...

53
00:07:21.284 --> 00:07:24.918
Look, I'll tell you what, I'll
definitely bear it in mind.

54
00:07:25.683 --> 00:07:26.683
All right?

55
00:07:27.946 --> 00:07:29.731
Come on, Dug.

56
00:07:29.733 --> 00:07:32.314
Right, gather round.

57
00:07:33.335 --> 00:07:34.386
Grab a spear.

58
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:37.317
Oh! It's pointy!

59
00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:40.983
- Oh, Treebor. Just get over there.
- Aw, Mum!

60
00:07:40.985 --> 00:07:42.545
- Morning, Barry.
- Morning, Dug.

61
00:07:42.547 --> 00:07:44.458
Mr. Rock coming hunting today?

62
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.041
Oh, yeah, wouldn't miss it
for the world.

63
00:07:47.043 --> 00:07:49.559
Morning, Asbo.
Change your underpants today?

64
00:07:49.561 --> 00:07:51.471
Yeah! Changed them
with Thongo, Chief.

65
00:07:51.473 --> 00:07:52.492
Champion!

66
00:07:52.494 --> 00:07:53.575
Mmm.

67
00:07:53.577 --> 00:07:55.967
- Chief.
- Yes, Gravelle?

68
00:07:55.969 --> 00:07:58.711
When I put my arm up, it hurts.

69
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.354
Well, don't do it, then.

70
00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:04.067
Grubup, don't eat that.
That's Eemak.

71
00:08:04.512 --> 00:08:05.978
Yum!

72
00:08:09.676 --> 00:08:12.098
Exactly. Uh... Right.

73
00:08:12.751 --> 00:08:14.185
Heads down, everyone.

74
00:08:14.791 --> 00:08:16.036
Thank you, Dug.

75
00:08:17.533 --> 00:08:18.999
Shh!

76
00:08:22.028 --> 00:08:25.309
We give thanks for our valley,
our home,

77
00:08:25.311 --> 00:08:28.082
this precious ground,
which sustains us

78
00:08:28.083 --> 00:08:31.812
and gives us shelter
from the Badlands.

79
00:08:31.813 --> 00:08:36.498
May we live in peace, balance,
and harmony with our forest

80
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.243
and all the creatures
we share it with.

81
00:08:42.048 --> 00:08:43.958
Right, let's go kill something.

82
00:09:34.776 --> 00:09:35.776
A rabbit!

83
00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:42.014
That's it. That's it.

84
00:09:44.659 --> 00:09:46.984
I've got him.

85
00:09:46.986 --> 00:09:48.294
To you, Eemak.

86
00:09:49.887 --> 00:09:51.383
Ouch.

87
00:09:55.467 --> 00:09:56.643
Nice try, though.

88
00:09:56.645 --> 00:09:58.939
Let's use
an element of surprise.

89
00:10:00.695 --> 00:10:02.318
Righto, Chief.

90
00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.370
Ow!

91
00:10:03.372 --> 00:10:04.372
I got him!

92
00:10:07.102 --> 00:10:08.185
No, I haven't!

93
00:10:08.186 --> 00:10:10.799
Great! Champion!

94
00:10:14.848 --> 00:10:15.866
Got you!

95
00:10:15.868 --> 00:10:16.951
Whoa!

96
00:10:16.953 --> 00:10:18.132
I got this, Gravelle.

97
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.764
Ha-hey!

98
00:10:34.678 --> 00:10:36.652
Well done, Mr. Rock!

99
00:10:38.901 --> 00:10:40.813
Nice job, everyone.

100
00:10:40.815 --> 00:10:43.015
Rabbit surprise tonight!

101
00:10:56.977 --> 00:10:58.601
See, Dug?

102
00:10:58.603 --> 00:11:01.534
We hunt rabbits,
everyone's happy.

103
00:11:03.258 --> 00:11:05.297
Although the thing
about rabbits, Chief,

104
00:11:05.299 --> 00:11:07.240
well, they are quite small.

105
00:11:07.242 --> 00:11:09.857
Dug, Dug. Look at us...

106
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.604
You seriously think
we could catch a mammoth?

107
00:11:14.606 --> 00:11:16.167
Nice moves, Mr. Rock.

108
00:11:16.169 --> 00:11:17.348
Us lot?

109
00:11:18.496 --> 00:11:19.740
You've been practicing.

110
00:11:32.778 --> 00:11:34.721
Shush, everyone.

111
00:12:12.308 --> 00:12:14.890
The rabbits are fighting back!

112
00:12:16.422 --> 00:12:18.271
I don't think this is rabbits.

113
00:12:19.928 --> 00:12:21.108
Attack!

114
00:12:34.401 --> 00:12:36.123
Run!

115
00:12:53.801 --> 00:12:55.140
Mr. Rock!

116
00:12:57.816 --> 00:12:59.504
No!

117
00:12:59.506 --> 00:13:01.611
No!

118
00:13:02.534 --> 00:13:04.350
To the Badlands!

119
00:13:04.352 --> 00:13:06.198
What, leave the valley?

120
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.668
Come on. Just run.

121
00:13:09.899 --> 00:13:10.899
Hognob!

122
00:13:19.494 --> 00:13:20.800
Where's Dug?

123
00:13:20.802 --> 00:13:21.918
Have you seen Dug?

124
00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:27.432
- Go on.
- Thank you, Chief.

125
00:13:29.409 --> 00:13:30.526
Dug!

126
00:14:08.334 --> 00:14:09.674
Hmm...

127
00:14:10.215 --> 00:14:11.745
Excellent.

128
00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.356
All right, secure the valley.

129
00:14:18.184 --> 00:14:19.907
Start mining ore.

130
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:22.266
Or what, Lord Nooth?

131
00:14:25.008 --> 00:14:28.990
Ore, you fool!
Start mining the ore.

132
00:14:28.992 --> 00:14:30.874
The metal that's in the ground.

133
00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:35.237
Oh, the ore! In the ground.

134
00:14:35.239 --> 00:14:36.239
Yes.

135
00:14:39.991 --> 00:14:41.171
What about the primitives?

136
00:14:42.063 --> 00:14:44.101
Oh, let them rot
in The Badlands.

137
00:14:44.103 --> 00:14:45.758
They are
the low-achievers of history

138
00:14:46.045 --> 00:14:47.413
with their puny flints
and their drafty caves.

139
00:14:47.415 --> 00:14:49.837
You've picked the wrong
tribe to mess with.

140
00:14:49.839 --> 00:14:52.100
Oh, I am so scared!
You are waving your stones about!

141
00:14:53.538 --> 00:14:55.607
The Age of Stone is over, Dino.

142
00:14:56.693 --> 00:14:59.560
Long live the Age of Bronze!

143
00:15:04.599 --> 00:15:06.544
Oh.

144
00:15:13.717 --> 00:15:15.437
Okay, let's get moving.

145
00:15:15.439 --> 00:15:17.062
Of course, Lord Nooth.

146
00:15:17.064 --> 00:15:18.659
I'm late for my massage.

147
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.233
Huh?

148
00:16:11.865 --> 00:16:12.865
Uh...

149
00:16:36.527 --> 00:16:38.440
What are you doing?
Get out of the way!

150
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:40.161
Hey! Hey!

151
00:16:50.521 --> 00:16:52.531
Multi-purpose pen swords!

152
00:16:53.709 --> 00:16:56.228
Very handy
for opening bottles, too!

153
00:16:56.738 --> 00:16:58.553
Sliced bread. Wow!

154
00:16:58.555 --> 00:17:01.678
That's the best thing since...
Well, ever!

155
00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:02.956
Oh!

156
00:17:07.481 --> 00:17:08.629
Hmm.

157
00:17:09.905 --> 00:17:11.209
Hey!

158
00:17:11.211 --> 00:17:14.046
- Huh?
- Don't touch the bronze.

159
00:17:14.048 --> 00:17:15.767
- The what?
- The bronze!

160
00:17:15.769 --> 00:17:17.683
Where have you been,
the Stone Age?

161
00:17:18.226 --> 00:17:19.692
Oh. Uh...

162
00:17:20.616 --> 00:17:21.637
What?

163
00:17:45.258 --> 00:17:48.349
Fifty schnookels!
Fifty schnookels!

164
00:17:48.705 --> 00:17:52.241
Voluntary contribution.
Everyone has to pay!

165
00:17:52.243 --> 00:17:53.325
It's gone up again.

166
00:17:53.327 --> 00:17:55.524
- It's daylight robbery!
- Fifty schnookels!

167
00:17:55.526 --> 00:17:57.183
Voluntary contribution!

168
00:17:57.184 --> 00:17:59.828
Hey! She hasn't
voluntarily contributed.

169
00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:01.773
Hmm? Stop her!

170
00:18:03.274 --> 00:18:05.952
- Hey. Hey.
- Oi! Stop her!

171
00:18:26.482 --> 00:18:28.044
Whoa!

172
00:18:35.619 --> 00:18:36.925
Hmm?

173
00:18:36.927 --> 00:18:40.400
Hello. Oh!

174
00:18:45.757 --> 00:18:47.479
Sorry!

175
00:18:53.311 --> 00:18:54.266
I tell you,

176
00:18:54.268 --> 00:18:56.658
I wouldn't want to
be facing me out there.

177
00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:06.349
Hey, Hügelgraber,
can't you see in that thing?

178
00:19:06.351 --> 00:19:08.010
The arena's this way.

179
00:19:12.471 --> 00:19:16.231
You girls are gonna
get slaughtered.

180
00:19:17.956 --> 00:19:19.610
Let's go!

181
00:19:37.337 --> 00:19:42.977
<i>All stand for our mighty
leader, Lord Nooth!</i>

182
00:19:45.147 --> 00:19:49.002
<i>Who challenges the champions?</i>

183
00:19:49.004 --> 00:19:51.808
We challenge the champions!

184
00:19:51.809 --> 00:19:54.231
We accept the challenge!

185
00:19:56.751 --> 00:19:59.012
<i>The hour has come.</i>

186
00:20:01.564 --> 00:20:04.753
<i>Let the sacred game commence!</i>

187
00:20:14.955 --> 00:20:18.714
<i>Introducing Real Bronzio</i>

188
00:20:18.716 --> 00:20:21.997
<i>and the captain, Jurgend!</i>

189
00:20:21.999 --> 00:20:26.684
<i>Today's match official,
Referee Dino!</i>

190
00:20:26.686 --> 00:20:29.648
<i>In the name of Queen Oofeefa,</i>

191
00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:32.872
<i>we give thanks
for the beautiful game.</i>

192
00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:36.408
<i>Oggy! Oggy! Oggy!</i>

193
00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:38.225
Oi! Oi! Oi!

194
00:20:38.227 --> 00:20:40.744
<i>Let's play football!</i>

195
00:20:43.455 --> 00:20:46.133
Whilst I count my schnookels.

196
00:20:58.917 --> 00:21:01.336
Hügelgraber!
What are you doing?

197
00:21:01.338 --> 00:21:02.644
Get in the goal!

198
00:21:02.646 --> 00:21:06.026
What's up with Hügelgraber?
Come on!

199
00:21:11.796 --> 00:21:13.039
Pick it up! Pick it up!

200
00:21:13.836 --> 00:21:15.399
To me! To me!

201
00:21:17.003 --> 00:21:19.136
What? Put it down!

202
00:21:19.137 --> 00:21:20.159
Put it down!

203
00:21:22.901 --> 00:21:23.901
Free kick!

204
00:21:26.948 --> 00:21:29.723
Hügelgraber!
Just get in the game!

205
00:21:51.528 --> 00:21:53.694
Just kick it!

206
00:22:04.183 --> 00:22:05.715
Huh?

207
00:22:12.824 --> 00:22:13.824
Huh?

208
00:22:15.533 --> 00:22:17.539
What are you doing, Hügelgraber?

209
00:22:17.541 --> 00:22:19.420
You just scored an own goal!

210
00:22:21.462 --> 00:22:23.277
He's not me!

211
00:22:23.279 --> 00:22:25.289
Huh?

212
00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.834
Oh!

213
00:22:30.836 --> 00:22:32.462
Huh?

214
00:22:32.907 --> 00:22:34.531
A caveman?

215
00:22:34.533 --> 00:22:38.006
- A caveman?
- A caveman?

216
00:22:38.008 --> 00:22:40.877
Playing the sacred game?
Bring him here.

217
00:22:43.269 --> 00:22:44.987
How dare you...

218
00:22:44.989 --> 00:22:47.570
Oh.

219
00:22:47.572 --> 00:22:51.015
How dare you set foot
on our hallowed ground?

220
00:22:54.044 --> 00:22:56.752
You took our ground.

221
00:22:56.753 --> 00:22:59.556
- Our home!
- Oh, that.

222
00:22:59.558 --> 00:23:01.405
Listen, you Stone Age brute.

223
00:23:01.407 --> 00:23:03.987
You have no home.

224
00:23:03.989 --> 00:23:06.699
Your kind are finished
on this Earth.

225
00:23:07.432 --> 00:23:08.995
Now take him away and kill him.

226
00:23:09.664 --> 00:23:10.664
Slowly.

227
00:23:14.828 --> 00:23:18.398
Argh! No, I mean
take him away at normal speed

228
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.630
and kill him slowly. Idiots!

229
00:23:20.632 --> 00:23:22.352
Now get on with the game.

230
00:23:24.903 --> 00:23:27.992
<i>We challenge the champions!</i>

231
00:23:27.994 --> 00:23:29.718
Wait... Wait!

232
00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:45.016
We challenge the champions!

233
00:23:45.018 --> 00:23:46.199
Huh?

234
00:23:46.868 --> 00:23:49.288
What did you say?

235
00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:52.224
- He said, "We challenge..."
- I heard what he said!

236
00:23:53.116 --> 00:23:56.461
If we win, we keep our valley.

237
00:23:56.463 --> 00:23:58.726
You leave my tribe in peace.

238
00:23:59.712 --> 00:24:00.712
Hmm.

239
00:24:01.091 --> 00:24:05.874
You think you can beat us
at football?

240
00:24:14.418 --> 00:24:17.989
A match between
the Bronze and the brutes?

241
00:24:18.497 --> 00:24:20.090
What an idea!

242
00:24:20.092 --> 00:24:22.959
Sacrilege, O Premier Leader!

243
00:24:22.961 --> 00:24:24.171
Yes. Quite.

244
00:24:24.173 --> 00:24:28.223
The masses would flock to see
such a vulgar spectacle. Pah!

245
00:24:28.763 --> 00:24:29.763
Hmm...

246
00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:31.919
Oh!

247
00:24:32.748 --> 00:24:33.832
Really?

248
00:24:34.851 --> 00:24:37.435
For the valley, you say?

249
00:24:55.351 --> 00:24:56.351
Hmm?

250
00:25:04.915 --> 00:25:06.125
- Dug!
- It's Dug!

251
00:25:06.126 --> 00:25:07.817
He's alive!

252
00:25:09.983 --> 00:25:13.427
Uh, what's that crazy fruit
he's got?

253
00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:16.454
"Football"?

254
00:25:16.456 --> 00:25:18.429
What's "football"?

255
00:25:18.431 --> 00:25:20.247
And how's it going to get
our valley back?

256
00:25:20.249 --> 00:25:23.435
Well, it's this amazing game,
Chief.

257
00:25:23.437 --> 00:25:25.028
And the leader
of the Bronze people,

258
00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:27.962
he says if we play this game
and beat them at it...

259
00:25:27.964 --> 00:25:29.747
Ooh, nice tight shorts!

260
00:25:29.749 --> 00:25:30.861
Aw, Mum!

261
00:25:30.863 --> 00:25:32.775
We can have our valley back.

262
00:25:32.777 --> 00:25:34.719
That's what we want.

263
00:25:34.721 --> 00:25:37.110
- And if we don't beat them?
- Ah.

264
00:25:37.112 --> 00:25:38.227
Well, then,

265
00:25:38.812 --> 00:25:41.998
he said we'll spend the rest
of our miserable lives

266
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.337
working down a mine.

267
00:25:43.339 --> 00:25:46.624
No!

268
00:25:47.739 --> 00:25:49.524
- What's a "mine"?
- Dug,

269
00:25:50.544 --> 00:25:52.868
we've never even played
this game.

270
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:53.955
But that's just it.

271
00:25:54.816 --> 00:25:56.725
We did. Once.

272
00:25:56.727 --> 00:25:57.619
Huh?

273
00:25:57.621 --> 00:26:00.647
Those cave paintings
back in our valley,

274
00:26:00.649 --> 00:26:04.951
they're pictures of our
ancestors playing football.

275
00:26:12.891 --> 00:26:15.315
- Champion!
- So if they did it,

276
00:26:16.239 --> 00:26:17.734
surely we can do it.

277
00:26:20.191 --> 00:26:23.154
Sorry! Shimmering memories
make me sneeze.

278
00:26:23.156 --> 00:26:25.481
This doesn't change anything,
Dug.

279
00:26:25.483 --> 00:26:27.012
It's just too risky.

280
00:26:27.013 --> 00:26:29.402
Oh, come on, Chief!
We can do it, Chief!

281
00:26:29.404 --> 00:26:31.956
I wanna play football!
I wanna play now!

282
00:26:32.273 --> 00:26:34.088
Now!

283
00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:36.864
Listen...
No, we're not... No!

284
00:26:39.224 --> 00:26:42.568
All right, then.
Don't worry about us.

285
00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:44.928
Yeah, we'll...
We'll be okay.

286
00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:47.418
We'll just die a slow and
lingering death in the Badlands.

287
00:26:47.862 --> 00:26:48.862
Huh?

288
00:26:49.297 --> 00:26:51.018
Come on, Chief.

289
00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:53.888
Just give us a chance. Please!

290
00:26:59.546 --> 00:27:01.678
Look, all right.

291
00:27:03.178 --> 00:27:06.237
Maybe we'll give this
"football" idea a try, then.

292
00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.359
No promises, mind.

293
00:27:12.361 --> 00:27:14.877
The match is to be played
at the full moon.

294
00:27:16.505 --> 00:27:19.500
And then we go back
to the valley!

295
00:27:19.502 --> 00:27:22.432
Sweet!

296
00:27:40.063 --> 00:27:42.484
Right, line up,
everybody! In line!

297
00:27:42.486 --> 00:27:44.780
- All yours, Dug.
- Thanks, Chief.

298
00:27:44.782 --> 00:27:46.058
All right!

299
00:27:46.695 --> 00:27:49.275
- Um...
- Um...

300
00:27:49.277 --> 00:27:51.507
Are hogs supposed
to play football?

301
00:27:51.508 --> 00:27:53.227
No. Oh...

302
00:27:53.229 --> 00:27:55.778
Probably not, no.
Sorry, Hognob.

303
00:27:59.733 --> 00:28:02.761
This is a football.

304
00:28:02.762 --> 00:28:06.840
One side tries to kick
the ball into this goal.

305
00:28:06.842 --> 00:28:08.753
Ooh.

306
00:28:08.755 --> 00:28:12.835
And the other side tries
to kick the ball in that goal.

307
00:28:12.836 --> 00:28:13.793
Ahh!

308
00:28:13.813 --> 00:28:15.660
Football sounds hard.

309
00:28:15.662 --> 00:28:18.306
What happens if you kick
the ball in the goal?

310
00:28:18.308 --> 00:28:20.379
Well, if you kick the ball
in the goal,

311
00:28:20.381 --> 00:28:22.230
then other men hug and kiss you.

312
00:28:23.791 --> 00:28:25.193
- Oh.
- Mmm.

313
00:28:25.195 --> 00:28:26.723
Right, who wants to try?

314
00:28:26.724 --> 00:28:27.870
I'll give it a go.

315
00:28:27.872 --> 00:28:29.145
- Nice one.
- Aw, Mum!

316
00:28:29.146 --> 00:28:33.544
Good, Magma. All right, okay, good.
Right. Um...

317
00:28:33.546 --> 00:28:36.255
So I'm...
I'm gonna try and get the ball,

318
00:28:36.257 --> 00:28:38.425
and you have to stop me, okay?

319
00:28:41.421 --> 00:28:43.044
Come on, come on!

320
00:28:43.046 --> 00:28:46.041
Ow!

321
00:28:46.043 --> 00:28:48.370
- Nice one, Mum!
- Football's brilliant.

322
00:28:48.372 --> 00:28:50.632
That can't be right.

323
00:28:50.634 --> 00:28:53.470
Surely, you can't hit
other players?

324
00:28:53.472 --> 00:28:55.860
No, you're supposed
to attack the ball.

325
00:28:58.222 --> 00:29:00.610
No, no, no, no, not weapons!

326
00:29:00.612 --> 00:29:01.630
Just use fist?

327
00:29:01.632 --> 00:29:04.245
No! No fighting at all.

328
00:29:04.247 --> 00:29:06.096
- Where's the fun in that?
- Uh...

329
00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.454
Hmm.

330
00:29:20.167 --> 00:29:22.113
Okay, Thongo!

331
00:29:22.749 --> 00:29:24.533
Oh!

332
00:29:24.535 --> 00:29:25.874
Ooh!

333
00:29:27.371 --> 00:29:28.741
- Oh!
- Yes!

334
00:29:28.742 --> 00:29:31.581
Good effort. Great.
Okay, next.

335
00:29:33.174 --> 00:29:34.447
Huh?

336
00:29:34.449 --> 00:29:35.502
Hognob.

337
00:29:39.294 --> 00:29:40.790
Go for it, Asbo.

338
00:29:43.598 --> 00:29:44.969
Yay!

339
00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:47.744
Yay!

340
00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:53.639
Oh...

341
00:30:00.909 --> 00:30:02.756
Excuse me!

342
00:30:02.758 --> 00:30:04.670
Can we have our ball back,
please?

343
00:30:07.348 --> 00:30:08.433
Huh. Hmm.

344
00:30:11.301 --> 00:30:14.201
Trust me, Dino.
This football match between

345
00:30:14.203 --> 00:30:16.177
the Stone Age
and the Bronze World,

346
00:30:16.178 --> 00:30:18.314
it's perfect!

347
00:30:18.316 --> 00:30:21.408
- Oh, how I love it!
- Yes, football.

348
00:30:22.299 --> 00:30:23.320
No.

349
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:25.773
Bronze!

350
00:30:25.775 --> 00:30:28.450
Mmm.

351
00:30:28.452 --> 00:30:31.352
So cold and hard and slippery.

352
00:30:31.354 --> 00:30:32.882
Mmm.

353
00:30:32.884 --> 00:30:34.604
Ooh.

354
00:30:34.606 --> 00:30:38.014
And this game is going
to make me loads of it.

355
00:30:38.016 --> 00:30:41.171
Your Premiership,
what if the Queen finds out?

356
00:30:41.173 --> 00:30:43.338
That old crow?

357
00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:45.315
She doesn't know
what goes on out here.

358
00:30:45.317 --> 00:30:46.621
Luckily.

359
00:30:50.609 --> 00:30:52.010
Delivering message!

360
00:30:52.012 --> 00:30:54.436
Your Footballness,
it's a Message Bird.

361
00:30:54.912 --> 00:30:56.061
Huh?

362
00:30:58.994 --> 00:31:01.066
Ugh. Well, go on, make it...

363
00:31:06.707 --> 00:31:08.206
"Hello? Hello?"

364
00:31:09.939 --> 00:31:11.946
"How do you use
this Message Bird thing?"

365
00:31:11.948 --> 00:31:13.000
It's the Queen.

366
00:31:15.231 --> 00:31:17.078
"Just speak into its ear, ma'am."

367
00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.457
"It will mimic
everything it hears."

368
00:31:20.459 --> 00:31:23.772
"I don't even know if
I'm holding it the... Testing!"

369
00:31:23.774 --> 00:31:25.270
"Testing!"

370
00:31:25.272 --> 00:31:26.738
"Nooth? Nooth?"

371
00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:29.161
Perhaps she's heard
about the game.

372
00:31:29.163 --> 00:31:31.455
Of course she hasn't
heard about the game.

373
00:31:31.457 --> 00:31:33.400
"I've heard about the game.

374
00:31:33.402 --> 00:31:37.866
- "You, arranging a football
match against a bunch of savages?

375
00:31:38.312 --> 00:31:40.000
"You idiot!"

376
00:31:40.002 --> 00:31:41.817
"Imagine if we lost."

377
00:31:41.818 --> 00:31:44.050
- We won't.
- "I said, imagine it!"

378
00:31:44.783 --> 00:31:46.249
"Exactly!"

379
00:31:46.251 --> 00:31:48.319
"The mighty Bronze Age"

380
00:31:48.321 --> 00:31:51.571
"brought to its knees
by a bunch of cavemen?"

381
00:31:51.573 --> 00:31:54.122
"Well, I'm warning you, Nooth."

382
00:31:54.124 --> 00:31:56.325
"You'd better not lose."

383
00:31:57.088 --> 00:31:58.936
"Hmm?"

384
00:32:00.117 --> 00:32:01.489
End of message.

385
00:32:04.133 --> 00:32:05.473
Oh! Hmm.

386
00:32:07.068 --> 00:32:08.850
Silly old bat!

387
00:32:08.852 --> 00:32:11.432
How dare she talk
to me like that!

388
00:32:11.434 --> 00:32:14.078
"Silly old bat!"

389
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.203
"How dare she talk
to me like that?"

390
00:32:17.205 --> 00:32:18.542
Delivering message!

391
00:32:21.795 --> 00:32:25.140
Guards! Get that bird back!

392
00:32:25.142 --> 00:32:27.723
What does the Queen know anyway?

393
00:32:27.725 --> 00:32:30.560
The cavemen are oafs.
My players are...

394
00:32:30.561 --> 00:32:31.583
Overpaid?

395
00:32:31.933 --> 00:32:33.176
Champions!

396
00:32:34.133 --> 00:32:36.172
Oh, yes, champions.

397
00:32:36.174 --> 00:32:40.953
They spend their days thinking,
sleeping, eating football.

398
00:32:40.955 --> 00:32:43.920
<i>And I hardly think
the cavemen will be doing that.</i>

399
00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:46.755
Rise and shine!

400
00:32:47.151 --> 00:32:48.425
Training time!

401
00:32:57.448 --> 00:32:58.723
Ow!

402
00:32:59.839 --> 00:33:02.865
No, not like that.

403
00:33:03.793 --> 00:33:06.950
When I said "free kick,"
I meant of the ball.

404
00:33:07.395 --> 00:33:09.050
Sorry, Dug.

405
00:33:09.052 --> 00:33:11.091
Hognob, no!

406
00:33:14.535 --> 00:33:17.051
Barry, where are you going?
No, don't wander off!

407
00:33:17.053 --> 00:33:18.709
Football's hard.

408
00:33:18.711 --> 00:33:21.356
Dug, my toe hurts!

409
00:33:25.344 --> 00:33:27.416
Grubup, drop it!
I told you,

410
00:33:28.625 --> 00:33:31.210
it's the only one we've got.

411
00:33:32.037 --> 00:33:33.311
Come on, everyone!

412
00:33:33.313 --> 00:33:36.627
We should be able to do this.
No, don't... Don't sit down.

413
00:33:36.629 --> 00:33:38.510
Grubup no like football.

414
00:33:39.146 --> 00:33:41.441
Make Grubup hungry.

415
00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:46.511
Oh. Oh, ho-ho.

416
00:33:47.595 --> 00:33:50.210
Food. Yum!

417
00:33:59.805 --> 00:34:00.805
Huh?

418
00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:10.483
Oh...

419
00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:17.304
Duck! Duck!

420
00:34:17.305 --> 00:34:18.453
Huh?

421
00:34:18.455 --> 00:34:20.622
No! Duck!

422
00:34:22.962 --> 00:34:25.832
Look!
It's a giant man-eating mallard!

423
00:34:26.724 --> 00:34:27.744
Run away!

424
00:34:31.887 --> 00:34:33.128
Huh?

425
00:35:05.647 --> 00:35:08.071
You haven't eaten
your primordial soup.

426
00:35:08.517 --> 00:35:09.889
Not really hungry.

427
00:35:11.321 --> 00:35:12.662
Oh...

428
00:35:13.171 --> 00:35:14.257
Huh?

429
00:35:22.511 --> 00:35:25.602
Dug, it's time to give up
this football lark

430
00:35:25.604 --> 00:35:27.355
for their sake.

431
00:35:27.357 --> 00:35:29.208
They're just not capable of it.

432
00:35:30.196 --> 00:35:32.297
Don't you miss the valley,
Chief?

433
00:35:32.299 --> 00:35:34.879
The valley's gone now.

434
00:35:34.881 --> 00:35:37.016
And we're better off
here in the Badlands

435
00:35:37.018 --> 00:35:38.673
than slaving down some mine.

436
00:35:38.675 --> 00:35:40.840
I mean, there's
the odd giant duck around,

437
00:35:40.842 --> 00:35:42.916
but at least
we're still together.

438
00:35:43.744 --> 00:35:44.922
We're still a tribe.

439
00:35:44.924 --> 00:35:47.089
But our ancestors
played football.

440
00:35:47.091 --> 00:35:49.033
We know they did.

441
00:35:49.035 --> 00:35:51.266
I still believe we can do this.

442
00:35:51.268 --> 00:35:53.209
With what?

443
00:35:53.211 --> 00:35:55.922
You haven't even got
a ball to play with.

444
00:36:01.533 --> 00:36:02.617
It's over.

445
00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:12.149
No. There's still time.

446
00:36:13.137 --> 00:36:14.254
Come on, Hognob.

447
00:36:33.284 --> 00:36:35.387
Okay, Hognob. Hognob?

448
00:36:35.389 --> 00:36:36.474
Huh?

449
00:36:47.694 --> 00:36:49.223
Right.

450
00:36:49.669 --> 00:36:50.976
Let's go get some balls.

451
00:36:57.511 --> 00:36:58.511
Shh!

452
00:36:59.008 --> 00:37:00.189
Shh!

453
00:37:14.534 --> 00:37:15.936
Ow!

454
00:37:20.446 --> 00:37:22.676
What strange magic is this?

455
00:37:28.448 --> 00:37:30.487
Hognob. You stay.

456
00:37:30.489 --> 00:37:31.809
I don't want
to attract attention.

457
00:37:34.283 --> 00:37:35.283
Huh?

458
00:38:07.596 --> 00:38:10.018
What's all that
crashing around out there?

459
00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:13.715
Is that you, Stefano?

460
00:38:13.717 --> 00:38:15.245
Huh?

461
00:38:15.247 --> 00:38:17.317
Stop messing about
and get in here

462
00:38:17.319 --> 00:38:19.679
with those firm hands of yours.

463
00:38:22.006 --> 00:38:23.006
Uh...

464
00:38:25.417 --> 00:38:27.168
Come on, Stefano!

465
00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:29.211
It's time for my massage.

466
00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:47.221
And the exciting new signing

467
00:38:47.223 --> 00:38:49.294
picks the ball up
in the center circle.

468
00:38:50.665 --> 00:38:52.069
She beats one,

469
00:38:52.801 --> 00:38:54.073
nutmegs another,

470
00:38:54.075 --> 00:38:56.784
lobs it neatly over
the big fullback.

471
00:38:56.786 --> 00:38:58.537
She's going all the way.

472
00:38:58.539 --> 00:38:59.539
She shoots!

473
00:39:00.166 --> 00:39:01.566
She scores!

474
00:39:01.568 --> 00:39:03.286
Yeah!

475
00:39:03.288 --> 00:39:06.539
And the crowd goes wild!

476
00:39:06.541 --> 00:39:08.326
Goal!

477
00:39:24.585 --> 00:39:27.612
Ah, I need this, Stefano.

478
00:39:27.614 --> 00:39:29.971
I'm feeling stressed.

479
00:39:29.972 --> 00:39:32.329
An hardworking governor like me,

480
00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:35.231
stuck out in
this miserable wasteland?

481
00:39:35.233 --> 00:39:37.844
He deserves a few perks.

482
00:39:37.846 --> 00:39:40.809
Simple pleasures like fine food,

483
00:39:40.811 --> 00:39:45.209
a massage,
his own champion football team.

484
00:39:45.211 --> 00:39:47.347
Well, come on, chop-chop,
I haven't got all day.

485
00:39:49.514 --> 00:39:52.065
Oh, my tendons are like ropes.

486
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:55.187
You can go the whole hog.

487
00:39:55.189 --> 00:39:56.189
Hmm?

488
00:39:59.812 --> 00:40:02.009
You're that crazy caveman guy.

489
00:40:02.011 --> 00:40:03.795
The angry pan girl.

490
00:40:03.797 --> 00:40:05.549
What are you doing here,
caveman?

491
00:40:05.551 --> 00:40:08.226
This is the sacred turf.
No one's allowed here.

492
00:40:08.228 --> 00:40:09.695
- Balls.
- Huh?

493
00:40:10.333 --> 00:40:11.668
I need balls.

494
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:12.690
You came all this way

495
00:40:12.692 --> 00:40:15.816
and broke into the stadium
just to find some balls?

496
00:40:17.651 --> 00:40:20.043
Wow.
You're pretty brave, caveman.

497
00:40:22.179 --> 00:40:23.484
And stupid.

498
00:40:23.486 --> 00:40:25.814
Actually,
more stupid than brave, really.

499
00:40:26.992 --> 00:40:27.992
Thanks.

500
00:40:28.905 --> 00:40:30.086
I'm Goona, by the way.

501
00:40:31.806 --> 00:40:32.825
Dug.

502
00:40:33.878 --> 00:40:35.885
Come on, I can help.

503
00:40:35.887 --> 00:40:38.502
Ahh, ohh, eee...

504
00:40:42.677 --> 00:40:44.301
That's good!

505
00:40:44.303 --> 00:40:45.452
Mmm.

506
00:40:47.331 --> 00:40:50.613
I don't know what
the Queen is worrying about.

507
00:40:50.615 --> 00:40:55.013
I mean, we all know
what losers cavemen are.

508
00:40:55.015 --> 00:40:58.331
Those Stone Age dolts couldn't
beat their own grandmothers.

509
00:40:58.871 --> 00:41:00.432
Brainless goons!

510
00:41:00.434 --> 00:41:02.153
Gormless halfwits!

511
00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:06.966
Stefano! Not so ham-fisted!

512
00:41:06.968 --> 00:41:08.848
In fact, enough massage.

513
00:41:08.849 --> 00:41:11.720
How about
some relaxing music instead?

514
00:41:14.684 --> 00:41:15.684
Huh?

515
00:41:19.498 --> 00:41:20.498
I envy you.

516
00:41:22.113 --> 00:41:23.513
- Me?
- The chance to play

517
00:41:23.515 --> 00:41:25.713
on that pitch, the sacred turf,

518
00:41:25.715 --> 00:41:28.234
in front of thousands of fans!

519
00:41:29.826 --> 00:41:32.215
Well, maybe you will one day.

520
00:41:32.217 --> 00:41:34.641
You think they let girls play
for Real Bronzio?

521
00:41:35.629 --> 00:41:37.794
You really are crazy.

522
00:41:37.796 --> 00:41:39.547
Why do you think
I sneak in here?

523
00:41:40.602 --> 00:41:41.602
Who is that?

524
00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:43.501
Scarper!

525
00:41:43.503 --> 00:41:45.606
Stop! Thieves!

526
00:41:45.608 --> 00:41:46.628
This way!

527
00:41:51.787 --> 00:41:53.220
They went that way!

528
00:41:53.222 --> 00:41:55.454
- Huh?
- No! That way!

529
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:03.329
Give me those, quick!

530
00:42:09.831 --> 00:42:11.362
Ow!

531
00:42:12.413 --> 00:42:13.495
You're really good!

532
00:42:13.497 --> 00:42:14.497
Thanks!

533
00:42:15.602 --> 00:42:16.813
I do a lot of practice.

534
00:42:21.149 --> 00:42:23.282
Oh, I've just had a great idea!

535
00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:33.646
Come on!

536
00:42:33.964 --> 00:42:34.964
Huh?

537
00:42:41.966 --> 00:42:44.899
What on Earth's
got into you tonight, Stefano?

538
00:42:45.472 --> 00:42:47.829
- Stefano?
- Yes, sir?

539
00:42:47.831 --> 00:42:48.831
Huh?

540
00:43:03.516 --> 00:43:04.602
Hognob!

541
00:43:06.545 --> 00:43:08.745
Hognob, meet Goona.
Goona, Hognob.

542
00:43:09.797 --> 00:43:10.797
Hi, Hognob.

543
00:43:23.568 --> 00:43:25.448
Sire, are you all right?

544
00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:28.572
Of course I'm not all right,
you idiot!

545
00:43:28.573 --> 00:43:31.283
I've just been massaged
by a pig!

546
00:43:40.496 --> 00:43:41.738
Wake up, everyone.

547
00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:44.160
I want you all to meet someone.

548
00:43:44.162 --> 00:43:46.234
This is Goona.

549
00:43:46.235 --> 00:43:47.541
Hi!

550
00:43:47.542 --> 00:43:49.484
And she's gonna help us
win the game.

551
00:43:49.486 --> 00:43:51.207
- Oh.
- Why would she do that?

552
00:43:51.208 --> 00:43:53.373
She gets to play
on the sacred turf

553
00:43:53.375 --> 00:43:55.063
in front of thousands of fans.

554
00:43:55.065 --> 00:43:56.338
Whoa.

555
00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:57.901
Glad to be on board.

556
00:43:57.903 --> 00:44:00.514
So what formation
do you normally play?

557
00:44:00.516 --> 00:44:02.810
Um... Formation?

558
00:44:02.812 --> 00:44:05.361
4-4-2 or 4-3-3?

559
00:44:05.363 --> 00:44:06.413
Who's your sweeper?

560
00:44:06.415 --> 00:44:07.464
Um...

561
00:44:07.466 --> 00:44:08.740
Do you man-mark or play zonally?

562
00:44:08.742 --> 00:44:10.270
Uh...

563
00:44:10.579 --> 00:44:12.904
We just kick the ball about
and chase it.

564
00:44:14.819 --> 00:44:17.621
You think you can beat
Real Bronzio

565
00:44:17.623 --> 00:44:19.346
just by chasing a ball around?

566
00:44:20.492 --> 00:44:22.343
You need to know
what you're up against.

567
00:44:25.945 --> 00:44:28.844
This is Jurgend, the captain.

568
00:44:28.846 --> 00:44:30.727
<i>Best goal-scorer
in the known world.</i>

569
00:44:32.288 --> 00:44:33.849
- <i>Knows it too.</i>
- Ha!

570
00:44:33.851 --> 00:44:36.463
Their winger, Lightning Hammer.

571
00:44:36.465 --> 00:44:39.140
<i>Never strikes twice
in the same place.</i>

572
00:44:41.501 --> 00:44:44.082
Midfield dynamo Qwik Wun Tu.

573
00:44:44.084 --> 00:44:45.803
<i>He can kick faster
than you can think.</i>

574
00:44:47.272 --> 00:44:49.186
Fullback, Gonad the Gaul.

575
00:44:51.033 --> 00:44:53.330
<i>No one gets past his tackle.</i>

576
00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:57.790
- Oh!
- Aw, Mum!

577
00:44:57.792 --> 00:44:59.004
Make no mistake.

578
00:45:00.342 --> 00:45:03.081
These are the best players
bronze can buy.

579
00:45:03.083 --> 00:45:08.660
They're like ginormous
great big footballing giants!

580
00:45:08.662 --> 00:45:11.564
Oh, there's no way we can beat
such a great team.

581
00:45:12.877 --> 00:45:14.247
They may be great,

582
00:45:14.249 --> 00:45:16.162
but what they're not is a team.

583
00:45:18.011 --> 00:45:19.698
They're 11 players

584
00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:21.707
who each think they're the star.

585
00:45:21.709 --> 00:45:23.333
That's their weakness.

586
00:45:23.335 --> 00:45:25.595
And that's how
you can beat them.

587
00:45:25.597 --> 00:45:27.256
- Oh.
- Hmm.

588
00:45:28.275 --> 00:45:29.677
Goona's right.

589
00:45:29.679 --> 00:45:32.228
They may be better
players than us,

590
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:34.298
but we have something
they don't.

591
00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:36.212
- Huh?
- Moss?

592
00:45:36.214 --> 00:45:38.092
No, Barry, not moss.

593
00:45:38.094 --> 00:45:40.197
We've got each other.

594
00:45:40.199 --> 00:45:44.535
And if we work together,
then maybe we can do this.

595
00:45:47.276 --> 00:45:49.634
Right. We've got
a lot of hard work to do.

596
00:45:49.636 --> 00:45:51.705
And we haven't even got
a full team.

597
00:45:51.707 --> 00:45:53.394
Oh, oh!

598
00:45:53.396 --> 00:45:54.396
What's going on?

599
00:45:55.245 --> 00:45:57.093
Oh, Chief, this is Goona,

600
00:45:57.095 --> 00:45:58.813
and she's going to
help us win the game.

601
00:45:58.815 --> 00:46:00.854
I thought we're done
with football.

602
00:46:00.856 --> 00:46:03.724
Not now you've turned up.
You're in the team.

603
00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:06.883
I'm not playing.
I'm an old man.

604
00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:09.429
I'm nearly 32.

605
00:46:09.431 --> 00:46:10.769
Okay, that is old.

606
00:46:10.771 --> 00:46:13.064
- Go in goal.
- Ow!

607
00:46:13.065 --> 00:46:14.945
Right, well,
that's settled, then.

608
00:46:14.947 --> 00:46:17.527
Now, where's
your training facilities?

609
00:46:17.529 --> 00:46:19.822
Real Bronzio have the very best.

610
00:46:19.824 --> 00:46:22.213
And all we've got is

611
00:46:24.221 --> 00:46:27.535
the Badlands.

612
00:46:28.315 --> 00:46:30.134
Three, two, one.

613
00:46:31.281 --> 00:46:32.907
This way, everyone!

614
00:46:34.436 --> 00:46:36.475
Wait! What? Oh!
What are you doing?

615
00:46:36.477 --> 00:46:37.944
That way, everyone!

616
00:46:49.769 --> 00:46:51.649
Ow! Ah! Ooh!

617
00:46:51.651 --> 00:46:53.181
This is a bit dangerous.

618
00:47:00.385 --> 00:47:01.566
What are you... What the...

619
00:47:08.165 --> 00:47:10.363
Eh? Well, I'll be...

620
00:47:10.365 --> 00:47:11.352
Okay. Pass and move.

621
00:47:11.354 --> 00:47:13.677
It's very important
that you pass and move.

622
00:47:13.679 --> 00:47:15.975
But whatever happens,
keep your formation.

623
00:47:35.677 --> 00:47:37.208
Oh! Oh!

624
00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:46.261
Ooh!

625
00:47:54.223 --> 00:47:56.229
Nice one, Asbo!
That's it!

626
00:47:56.231 --> 00:47:57.954
Everyone working together!

627
00:48:07.964 --> 00:48:09.842
Ugh! This is all I need.

628
00:48:09.844 --> 00:48:12.489
You found these
in the primitives' valley?

629
00:48:12.491 --> 00:48:15.486
It seems their ancestors
were playing football

630
00:48:15.488 --> 00:48:17.589
centuries before we were.

631
00:48:17.591 --> 00:48:20.362
The Queen must not find out
about this, all right?

632
00:48:22.086 --> 00:48:23.139
Delivering message!

633
00:48:23.745 --> 00:48:25.049
Oh, no.

634
00:48:25.051 --> 00:48:27.026
"What's this"

635
00:48:27.028 --> 00:48:29.608
"I hear about the savages"

636
00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:33.624
"playing football
centuries before we were?"

637
00:48:33.626 --> 00:48:35.633
Ow! Ow! I didn't know! Ow!

638
00:48:35.635 --> 00:48:40.096
"And my spies tell me
they're getting better.

639
00:48:40.098 --> 00:48:41.852
- Ow!
- "Training every day!"

640
00:48:42.267 --> 00:48:44.048
Ow! Ow! Ow!

641
00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:49.150
"You better not screw it up,
Nooth, or else,"

642
00:48:51.161 --> 00:48:54.728
"I'll tell you who'll be
going down the mine."

643
00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:55.876
"You will!"

644
00:48:56.963 --> 00:48:58.904
This has gone far enough.

645
00:48:58.906 --> 00:49:00.467
They're Stone Age brutes.

646
00:49:00.469 --> 00:49:02.060
They live in caves.

647
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:04.827
They eat mud! No.

648
00:49:04.829 --> 00:49:06.740
I need to shut them down.

649
00:49:06.742 --> 00:49:10.310
Mess with their
tiny cavemen minds.

650
00:49:10.312 --> 00:49:12.988
Brilliant! How do we do that?

651
00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:14.040
I don't know.

652
00:49:14.042 --> 00:49:16.497
The answer isn't just going
to walk in the door.

653
00:49:21.024 --> 00:49:22.999
Sire, we've found something else

654
00:49:23.001 --> 00:49:25.071
down in the new mine
in the valley.

655
00:49:25.072 --> 00:49:27.335
We've made a copy
for your inspection.

656
00:49:27.337 --> 00:49:28.645
Oh! Ow!

657
00:49:38.781 --> 00:49:40.981
That's perfect.

658
00:49:41.363 --> 00:49:42.575
Mmm.

659
00:49:47.994 --> 00:49:48.994
Hognob.

660
00:49:51.756 --> 00:49:55.452
Whoa! Great save, Chief!

661
00:49:55.454 --> 00:49:58.484
You know, we may just
stand a chance tomorrow.

662
00:49:59.088 --> 00:50:00.173
A small chance,

663
00:50:00.873 --> 00:50:01.893
but a chance.

664
00:50:01.895 --> 00:50:05.049
If our ancestors did it,
so can we.

665
00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:08.491
Hey, hey, not bad for 32, eh?

666
00:50:08.493 --> 00:50:09.990
I never thought
I'd say this, Dug,

667
00:50:09.992 --> 00:50:11.839
but we're pretty good.

668
00:50:11.841 --> 00:50:13.846
Oi, oi, oi! That's mine.

669
00:50:17.356 --> 00:50:18.408
I've got it.

670
00:50:32.754 --> 00:50:34.791
Soon be home.

671
00:50:34.793 --> 00:50:36.228
Huh?

672
00:50:39.129 --> 00:50:40.181
Huh?

673
00:50:40.915 --> 00:50:41.915
No!

674
00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:47.741
What are you doing?

675
00:50:47.743 --> 00:50:48.859
Let me go!

676
00:50:50.198 --> 00:50:53.128
Calm down, caveman.

677
00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:55.935
I just wanted you
to see our new mine.

678
00:50:57.753 --> 00:51:01.322
After all, you'll soon be digging
lots of bronze out of it.

679
00:51:01.324 --> 00:51:04.413
Oh, we're not going down
any mine, mammoth-mouth.

680
00:51:04.414 --> 00:51:06.263
Ah, yes.

681
00:51:06.265 --> 00:51:08.494
Because you're
great footballers,

682
00:51:08.496 --> 00:51:10.887
just like your ancestors.

683
00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:14.265
You... You know about them?

684
00:51:14.267 --> 00:51:17.837
Bronze is not all
we found down here.

685
00:51:32.087 --> 00:51:33.777
What... What...

686
00:51:35.913 --> 00:51:38.014
More cave paintings?

687
00:51:38.016 --> 00:51:39.419
Yes.

688
00:51:40.439 --> 00:51:43.723
Only these ones tell
the whole story.

689
00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:50.351
You see, your ancestors
did not just play football.

690
00:51:50.353 --> 00:51:51.980
They invented the game.

691
00:51:54.881 --> 00:51:57.750
You even taught
other tribes how to play.

692
00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:01.795
But you had one problem.

693
00:52:01.797 --> 00:52:04.666
No matter how hard you tried,

694
00:52:04.667 --> 00:52:08.048
you just always ended up losing,

695
00:52:09.131 --> 00:52:11.073
match after match,

696
00:52:11.075 --> 00:52:12.797
game after game.

697
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:17.357
In fact, after many, many moons,

698
00:52:18.854 --> 00:52:22.422
you just gave up altogether.

699
00:52:22.424 --> 00:52:25.037
It was all too painful for you.

700
00:52:25.039 --> 00:52:29.534
It turns out your tribe
were totally crap at football.

701
00:52:30.490 --> 00:52:32.433
You're losers, caveman.

702
00:52:32.435 --> 00:52:34.250
Always have been.

703
00:52:34.252 --> 00:52:35.589
Always will be.

704
00:52:35.591 --> 00:52:37.119
No.

705
00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.383
No, it can't be true.

706
00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:41.596
Do you really believe

707
00:52:41.598 --> 00:52:43.193
you can beat us tomorrow?

708
00:52:43.861 --> 00:52:45.486
Face it, caveman.

709
00:52:45.488 --> 00:52:49.122
You and your tribe,
you just don't have it in you.

710
00:52:50.525 --> 00:52:53.235
But I'm willing
to offer you a deal.

711
00:52:54.413 --> 00:52:56.072
A way out.

712
00:52:58.271 --> 00:53:00.914
Time to turn in.
Big day tomorrow.

713
00:53:00.916 --> 00:53:02.541
- Come on, Treebor!
- Night, Goona!

714
00:53:02.543 --> 00:53:04.295
Can I sleep in me football kit?

715
00:53:04.296 --> 00:53:06.337
- Night, everyone!
- Night, everyone!

716
00:53:07.644 --> 00:53:08.644
Huh?

717
00:53:12.266 --> 00:53:14.048
Think it over, caveman,

718
00:53:14.050 --> 00:53:16.217
because the mine is waiting

719
00:53:16.219 --> 00:53:18.867
for you and
your primitive friends.

720
00:53:33.051 --> 00:53:35.154
Oh! Me arm hurts!

721
00:53:35.156 --> 00:53:36.525
Oh!

722
00:53:36.527 --> 00:53:38.406
Where are you, Mum?

723
00:53:40.224 --> 00:53:43.635
You idiot!
What have you done?

724
00:53:45.772 --> 00:53:46.853
At the end of the day,

725
00:53:46.855 --> 00:53:49.436
we're just
a rabbit-hunting tribe.

726
00:53:49.437 --> 00:53:51.317
I'm sorry, Chief!

727
00:53:51.319 --> 00:53:53.452
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

728
00:53:53.454 --> 00:53:55.332
Bobnar, you've got
to believe me!

729
00:53:59.831 --> 00:54:00.975
Huh?

730
00:54:00.977 --> 00:54:02.602
Oh, Hognob!

731
00:54:06.716 --> 00:54:08.308
Oh!

732
00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:10.574
My dear old hoggy friend.

733
00:54:14.336 --> 00:54:15.898
What if I'm wrong?

734
00:54:17.365 --> 00:54:19.020
What if Chief was right
all along?

735
00:54:19.022 --> 00:54:20.009
Huh?

736
00:54:20.011 --> 00:54:23.995
What if we are just
a tribe of rabbit-hunters?

737
00:54:25.238 --> 00:54:26.480
Uh...

738
00:54:26.482 --> 00:54:27.694
Forgive me, Hognob.

739
00:54:29.032 --> 00:54:30.910
But I've got a deal to make.

740
00:54:30.912 --> 00:54:32.730
I've got to save the tribe.

741
00:54:43.394 --> 00:54:45.499
Huh?

742
00:54:57.172 --> 00:55:00.900
Get your cuddly caveman here!
Before they go extinct!

743
00:55:00.902 --> 00:55:02.397
One hundred schnookels!

744
00:55:02.399 --> 00:55:03.769
One hundred schnookels!

745
00:55:03.771 --> 00:55:06.861
Voluntary contribution.
Everyone has to pay.

746
00:55:06.863 --> 00:55:08.360
One hundred schnookels!

747
00:55:08.362 --> 00:55:10.943
- It has doubled!
- Voluntary contribution!

748
00:55:10.945 --> 00:55:13.110
- Everyone has to pay.
- This is outrageous!

749
00:55:13.112 --> 00:55:15.787
Have you got change
for a dinner plate?

750
00:55:17.797 --> 00:55:20.251
It's all going to plan, Dino.

751
00:55:20.252 --> 00:55:23.852
Ooh. I love you,
little bronze coin.

752
00:55:23.854 --> 00:55:25.575
Hello!

753
00:55:25.577 --> 00:55:28.604
I love you. I love you too.
And you too.

754
00:55:28.606 --> 00:55:30.197
Nooth!

755
00:55:30.198 --> 00:55:31.982
What are you doing?

756
00:55:31.984 --> 00:55:34.278
Ugh. Not that stupid
old bird again.

757
00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:36.923
Tell Chef to boil it up
in a cassoulet.

758
00:55:38.233 --> 00:55:40.653
"Stupid old bird"?

759
00:55:41.963 --> 00:55:43.873
"Cassoulet"?

760
00:55:43.875 --> 00:55:47.731
Oh!
Your Majesty!

761
00:55:47.733 --> 00:55:49.774
Why, this is an unexpected

762
00:55:50.410 --> 00:55:52.704
pleasure.

763
00:55:52.706 --> 00:55:56.178
Thought I'd come
to this caveman game myself.

764
00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:58.188
And have a little nose.

765
00:55:58.190 --> 00:56:00.805
A great honor, Your Majesty.

766
00:56:02.685 --> 00:56:04.053
<i>And you have to say, Brian,</i>

767
00:56:04.055 --> 00:56:08.484
<i>Real Bronzio's manager
is on the back foot.</i>

768
00:56:08.486 --> 00:56:10.430
<i>Oh, it's a terrible
start for the lad, Bryan.</i>

769
00:56:10.431 --> 00:56:12.374
<i>Terrible. I mean, just awful.</i>

770
00:56:12.376 --> 00:56:15.082
<i>I put it down
to pre-match nerves.</i>

771
00:56:15.084 --> 00:56:16.550
<i>You're not wrong there, Brian.</i>

772
00:56:16.552 --> 00:56:19.868
I've brought
my royal commentators with me.

773
00:56:20.282 --> 00:56:21.282
Sit!

774
00:56:21.971 --> 00:56:23.722
Right.

775
00:56:23.724 --> 00:56:26.783
Well, let's start the fun,
shall we?

776
00:56:26.785 --> 00:56:29.495
<i>Bring out
the Stone Age challengers!</i>

777
00:56:40.141 --> 00:56:42.500
What? Where are you taking me?

778
00:56:42.502 --> 00:56:44.925
What on Earth are
you playing at?

779
00:56:53.596 --> 00:56:55.605
Oh, Dug.

780
00:57:10.253 --> 00:57:14.111
<i>Who challenge the champions?</i>

781
00:57:16.308 --> 00:57:19.910
You'll leave
my people alone as agreed?

782
00:57:19.912 --> 00:57:22.017
Yes, just say the words.

783
00:57:24.088 --> 00:57:25.584
Not me.

784
00:57:26.829 --> 00:57:29.091
I forfeit the game

785
00:57:29.093 --> 00:57:31.610
and volunteer myself
for the mines.

786
00:57:33.301 --> 00:57:34.768
And?

787
00:57:36.042 --> 00:57:37.127
And our valley

788
00:57:38.147 --> 00:57:39.324
is yours.

789
00:57:39.326 --> 00:57:40.855
My goodness!

790
00:57:40.857 --> 00:57:42.643
Have the cavemen caved?

791
00:57:43.184 --> 00:57:45.988
Oh! So it seems.

792
00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:48.889
How very disappointing.

793
00:57:48.890 --> 00:57:52.971
<i>Everyone, go home!
There is no game.</i>

794
00:57:54.022 --> 00:57:57.080
<i>Apologies for the inconvenience.</i>

795
00:57:57.082 --> 00:57:59.154
Tell the staff, no refunds.

796
00:57:59.156 --> 00:58:01.290
Fowl! Fowl!

797
00:58:01.292 --> 00:58:04.828
<i>Foul? No one's even playing,
you silly slap-head!</i>

798
00:58:04.830 --> 00:58:06.647
No, fowl!

799
00:58:23.830 --> 00:58:25.072
<i>Well, Brian,</i>

800
00:58:25.073 --> 00:58:27.656
<i>it looks like the Stone Age
team have just flown in.</i>

801
00:58:29.058 --> 00:58:30.109
<i>That's right, Bryan.</i>

802
00:58:30.110 --> 00:58:32.722
<i>They're definitely looking
good in the air!</i>

803
00:58:32.724 --> 00:58:34.097
<i>See what I did there?</i>

804
00:58:35.338 --> 00:58:36.611
Oh, goodie.

805
00:58:36.613 --> 00:58:39.130
Seems there is a game after all.

806
00:59:03.935 --> 00:59:05.686
Gonna start without us, Dug?

807
00:59:06.015 --> 00:59:08.372
Chief, we can't play this game.

808
00:59:08.374 --> 00:59:10.827
What, because of
a few paintings?

809
00:59:10.829 --> 00:59:14.047
So you know about
those terrible pictures?

810
00:59:14.048 --> 00:59:15.194
They are terrible.

811
00:59:15.196 --> 00:59:17.267
I can draw better than that.

812
00:59:17.269 --> 00:59:18.928
But that's all they are.

813
00:59:19.724 --> 00:59:20.724
Pictures.

814
00:59:22.784 --> 00:59:24.283
It's this lot that counts.

815
00:59:25.143 --> 00:59:26.800
You were right, Dug.

816
00:59:26.801 --> 00:59:29.477
I thought
we were just rabbit-hunters.

817
00:59:29.479 --> 00:59:31.197
Well, not anymore.

818
00:59:31.199 --> 00:59:33.397
You've shown me that.

819
00:59:33.399 --> 00:59:35.757
Who's playing with Dug

820
00:59:35.759 --> 00:59:37.191
for the valley?

821
00:59:37.193 --> 00:59:39.203
Champion.

822
00:59:40.445 --> 00:59:42.741
It's what Mr. Rock
would've wanted.

823
00:59:52.049 --> 00:59:55.808
We challenge the champions!

824
00:59:57.437 --> 01:00:00.052
<i>Your funeral, caveman!</i>

825
01:00:04.482 --> 01:00:07.286
<i>This may be
an uneven contest, Brian,</i>

826
01:00:07.288 --> 01:00:09.581
<i>but let's hope
it's at least entertaining.</i>

827
01:00:09.583 --> 01:00:11.623
Ha! Let's get this done.

828
01:00:17.967 --> 01:00:18.967
What?

829
01:00:20.325 --> 01:00:22.046
Let's do it!

830
01:00:22.408 --> 01:00:23.907
<i>Oh! Well, this is interesting.</i>

831
01:00:25.437 --> 01:00:27.156
Hey, Hügelgraber!

832
01:00:27.158 --> 01:00:29.614
Wake up!

833
01:00:30.315 --> 01:00:31.782
<i>Very interesting!</i>

834
01:00:36.307 --> 01:00:37.421
Huh?

835
01:00:43.703 --> 01:00:45.965
<i>I don't believe it,</i>

836
01:00:45.967 --> 01:00:48.165
<i>Bryan! The Stone Age team</i>

837
01:00:48.167 --> 01:00:50.559
<i>have caught
their opponents napping.</i>

838
01:00:52.246 --> 01:00:55.689
Beginners' luck, Your Majesty.

839
01:00:55.691 --> 01:00:56.691
Hmph.

840
01:00:59.325 --> 01:01:00.820
Bad move, caveman.

841
01:01:00.822 --> 01:01:02.449
Now you've just made us mad.

842
01:01:06.561 --> 01:01:07.580
Oh!

843
01:01:07.582 --> 01:01:08.949
Yay!

844
01:01:08.951 --> 01:01:10.863
<i>And normal service is restored!</i>

845
01:01:10.865 --> 01:01:14.177
Jurgend! Jurgend!

846
01:01:14.179 --> 01:01:15.742
<i>Let's see the replay, Bryan.</i>

847
01:01:17.687 --> 01:01:19.853
Ooh, <i>ja,</i> kick!

848
01:01:19.855 --> 01:01:21.797
Yay! Goal!

849
01:01:21.799 --> 01:01:23.806
<i>You can't argue
with the puppets, Bryan.</i>

850
01:01:23.808 --> 01:01:25.303
Kissy-kissy!
Hug, hug, hug!

851
01:01:25.305 --> 01:01:27.410
<i>Aye,
the puppets don't lie, Brian.</i>

852
01:01:29.131 --> 01:01:31.138
Oh!

853
01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:32.923
Oh! Ah,
and that's a goal.

854
01:01:32.925 --> 01:01:34.294
That's two.

855
01:01:34.296 --> 01:01:35.315
<i>Real Bronzio are in</i>

856
01:01:35.317 --> 01:01:37.515
- <i>no mood to compromise.</i>
- Goal!

857
01:01:37.516 --> 01:01:39.493
Never mind. Come on, everyone!

858
01:01:41.830 --> 01:01:43.362
Boo!

859
01:01:47.951 --> 01:01:49.670
<i>And surely, that's settled it.</i>

860
01:01:52.255 --> 01:01:54.198
Yay!

861
01:01:58.503 --> 01:02:01.658
<i>Well, it's halftime,
Bryan, and Real Bronzio</i>

862
01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:03.253
<i>are dominating this match.</i>

863
01:02:03.255 --> 01:02:05.738
<i>♪ You're going down the mine!</i>

864
01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:07.778
<i>♪ You're going down the mine! ♪</i>

865
01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:11.316
The only place we're going
is back to the valley.

866
01:02:11.318 --> 01:02:12.848
Now come on, everyone!

867
01:02:13.205 --> 01:02:14.927
Let's show them what we've got!

868
01:02:24.681 --> 01:02:26.308
Remember your training, Eemak!

869
01:02:40.494 --> 01:02:42.723
Nice one, Eemak! That's it!

870
01:02:42.725 --> 01:02:45.592
<i>Goodness me, it looks
like a caveman counterattack.</i>

871
01:02:45.593 --> 01:02:47.826
Come on, then.
Let's see your tackle.

872
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:52.290
Great work, Magma!

873
01:02:53.278 --> 01:02:54.773
Hey, hey!

874
01:02:56.018 --> 01:02:57.579
What was that?

875
01:02:57.581 --> 01:02:59.779
<i>Oh-ho!
Unorthodox, Bryan,</i>

876
01:02:59.781 --> 01:03:00.898
<i>but effective.</i>

877
01:03:02.555 --> 01:03:04.688
- <i>This is unprecedented!</i>
- Yay!

878
01:03:04.690 --> 01:03:06.474
<i>I can't remember any side</i>

879
01:03:06.476 --> 01:03:09.217
<i>scoring two goals
against Real Bronzio.</i>

880
01:03:11.544 --> 01:03:13.741
Oh, you fool.
What were you playing at?

881
01:03:13.743 --> 01:03:15.018
You silly, stupid...

882
01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:17.887
Idiot! Do I have to do
everything around here?

883
01:03:17.889 --> 01:03:19.608
Caveman coming through!

884
01:03:19.610 --> 01:03:22.288
Nibbles, Your Majesty?

885
01:03:23.372 --> 01:03:24.453
Stuff your nibbles!

886
01:03:24.455 --> 01:03:26.208
<i>Well, Real Bronzio,</i>

887
01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:28.410
<i>they just don't know what's
hit them, they really don't.</i>

888
01:03:34.879 --> 01:03:38.130
<i>Oh-ho! The Stone Age team
is really coming together, Bryan.</i>

889
01:03:38.131 --> 01:03:41.062
<i>You're not wrong,
Brian. It's like early man</i>

890
01:03:41.064 --> 01:03:43.772
united. That's another joke
there, Brian.

891
01:03:43.774 --> 01:03:45.812
<i>Oh, look at this!</i>

892
01:03:45.814 --> 01:03:48.395
<i>The Stone Age striker beats one,</i>

893
01:03:48.397 --> 01:03:50.024
<i>nutmegs another...</i>

894
01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:53.399
All yours, Goona!

895
01:03:53.882 --> 01:03:54.882
Hmm.

896
01:03:55.891 --> 01:03:57.454
<i>She's going all the way.</i>

897
01:03:59.621 --> 01:04:02.042
<i>She shoots.</i>

898
01:04:02.044 --> 01:04:03.129
<i>She scores!</i>

899
01:04:05.392 --> 01:04:07.845
The crowd are going wild!

900
01:04:07.846 --> 01:04:10.778
- <i>And who can blame them?</i>
- Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

901
01:04:12.087 --> 01:04:12.945
Wait a minute!

902
01:04:12.947 --> 01:04:15.113
She shouldn't even be
on the pitch.

903
01:04:15.115 --> 01:04:16.802
And why not?

904
01:04:16.804 --> 01:04:18.491
Because she's a...

905
01:04:20.566 --> 01:04:22.607
A great player!

906
01:04:23.339 --> 01:04:25.028
You lot!

907
01:04:25.030 --> 01:04:26.589
Get your act together!

908
01:04:26.591 --> 01:04:30.162
Unless you want to be suspended
for the rest of the season.

909
01:04:30.449 --> 01:04:31.629
Play on!

910
01:04:36.824 --> 01:04:38.513
Hmm...

911
01:04:38.515 --> 01:04:39.790
- Psst. Dino! Dino!
- Eh?

912
01:04:41.861 --> 01:04:45.496
- Have you got your rule book handy?
- Of course.

913
01:04:46.612 --> 01:04:49.289
Good. Because
I'm throwing it at you.

914
01:04:49.544 --> 01:04:50.820
Eh?

915
01:04:53.816 --> 01:04:55.313
Come on, everyone.

916
01:04:55.315 --> 01:04:57.958
One last goal will take us home.

917
01:04:58.766 --> 01:05:00.517
Dino is having a lie-down.

918
01:05:00.519 --> 01:05:02.528
I am the new ref.

919
01:05:04.509 --> 01:05:06.229
Well, that's not fair!

920
01:05:06.231 --> 01:05:07.440
Oh, isn't it?

921
01:05:07.442 --> 01:05:09.035
Let's ask the new ref.

922
01:05:09.037 --> 01:05:10.629
Ref, is it fair?

923
01:05:10.631 --> 01:05:12.987
Oh, yes, it's totally fair.

924
01:05:12.989 --> 01:05:14.360
Okay. Play on!

925
01:05:15.284 --> 01:05:18.122
It's injury time. Understand?

926
01:05:25.932 --> 01:05:28.196
- Ooh!
- <i>Oh, that's not cricket, Bryan.</i>

927
01:05:29.121 --> 01:05:30.233
<i>Whatever cricket is.</i>

928
01:05:30.235 --> 01:05:32.241
Nothing to see there. Play on.

929
01:05:34.156 --> 01:05:36.260
- No!
- I didn't see anything.

930
01:05:36.262 --> 01:05:38.112
No foul! Play on!

931
01:05:40.537 --> 01:05:44.010
No, no. Get up. Play on.

932
01:05:44.705 --> 01:05:46.746
<i>Oh, that's way below the belt.</i>

933
01:05:57.967 --> 01:05:59.941
Chief!

934
01:05:59.943 --> 01:06:01.857
<i>Oh, caveman down, Brian!</i>

935
01:06:11.612 --> 01:06:14.446
Oh, my leg! Oh, my leg!

936
01:06:14.448 --> 01:06:16.456
Hurts so bad!

937
01:06:16.921 --> 01:06:18.736
Penalty!

938
01:06:18.738 --> 01:06:20.843
<i>Jurgend should get
a prize for acting.</i>

939
01:06:21.447 --> 01:06:23.804
Chief? Chief?

940
01:06:23.806 --> 01:06:25.909
Ha! I soon have it fixed.

941
01:06:25.911 --> 01:06:27.630
Oh, great.

942
01:06:27.632 --> 01:06:29.638
Um... Huh?

943
01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:31.480
Ha. There. Good job.

944
01:06:31.481 --> 01:06:33.869
Come on,
that was never a penalty!

945
01:06:33.871 --> 01:06:35.877
Fine.
Check the replay.

946
01:06:35.879 --> 01:06:38.364
Oh, kick, ahh! Referee!

947
01:06:38.366 --> 01:06:39.768
Oh, my leg! My leg!

948
01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:42.573
Oh, no, the crocodile!

949
01:06:42.575 --> 01:06:45.219
Snack, snack, snack.

950
01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:47.068
Oh, terrible foul!

951
01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:48.789
Beating him with sausages!

952
01:06:48.791 --> 01:06:51.308
Shame on you.
Definite penalty.

953
01:06:54.148 --> 01:06:58.735
<i>A draw is just not good enough
for the primitive part-timers, Bryan.</i>

954
01:06:58.737 --> 01:06:59.916
<i>And now this.</i>

955
01:06:59.918 --> 01:07:02.403
<i>A Real Bronzio penalty</i>

956
01:07:02.405 --> 01:07:04.953
<i>in the dying moments
of the match.</i>

957
01:07:04.955 --> 01:07:08.048
<i>Aye, and the goalie
looks in a bad way too.</i>

958
01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:13.554
Dug...

959
01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:15.559
Chief?

960
01:07:15.561 --> 01:07:18.972
I spent my whole life
hunting rabbits.

961
01:07:21.236 --> 01:07:22.448
I held you back.

962
01:07:24.042 --> 01:07:25.126
I'm sorry.

963
01:07:26.082 --> 01:07:28.824
I'm so...

964
01:07:33.381 --> 01:07:34.401
Chief?

965
01:07:35.709 --> 01:07:38.069
Chief!

966
01:07:41.893 --> 01:07:43.106
Huh?

967
01:07:49.066 --> 01:07:50.466
Dug,

968
01:07:50.468 --> 01:07:54.897
I don't mean to worry you, but what
are we going to do for a goalie?

969
01:08:06.345 --> 01:08:07.622
Hognob?

970
01:08:10.553 --> 01:08:11.574
Okay!

971
01:08:14.826 --> 01:08:18.429
<i>My word. Is that a pig
they just put in goal?</i>

972
01:08:20.371 --> 01:08:22.505
<i>Have to say that's rather rash.</i>

973
01:08:22.507 --> 01:08:24.898
- <i>Rasher. Do you get it? Bacon.</i>
- Mmm.

974
01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:27.223
I've never missed a penalty.

975
01:08:27.225 --> 01:08:31.082
Not against a pig anyway.

976
01:08:31.084 --> 01:08:32.739
<i>And it looks like it's all over</i>

977
01:08:32.741 --> 01:08:35.991
<i>for this plucky band
of knuckle-grazers, Bryan.</i>

978
01:08:35.993 --> 01:08:37.584
<i>A great effort,</i>

979
01:08:37.586 --> 01:08:40.201
<i>but, in the end,
it wasn't quite enough.</i>

980
01:08:45.365 --> 01:08:49.223
Say goodbye
to your valley, caveman.

981
01:08:50.370 --> 01:08:52.059
Come on, Hognob.

982
01:08:52.061 --> 01:08:53.145
You can do it.

983
01:09:16.766 --> 01:09:18.232
<i>He's got a trotter to it!</i>

984
01:09:20.815 --> 01:09:22.949
<i>It's still in play, Brian.</i>

985
01:09:26.458 --> 01:09:29.134
Dug. Dug!

986
01:09:29.136 --> 01:09:31.974
<i>You were always
a mammoth-hunter!</i>

987
01:09:33.345 --> 01:09:35.255
<i>Dug! Over here!</i>

988
01:09:35.257 --> 01:09:37.584
<i>Go hunt mammoth!</i>

989
01:09:39.210 --> 01:09:41.124
Everyone! Give me a hand!

990
01:09:41.761 --> 01:09:43.961
My ball!

991
01:09:51.196 --> 01:09:53.811
Don't crowd me!

992
01:10:14.011 --> 01:10:17.452
<i>That is an amazing goal!</i>

993
01:10:17.454 --> 01:10:19.399
Yay!

994
01:10:22.205 --> 01:10:24.051
<i>Look at that.</i>

995
01:10:24.053 --> 01:10:26.410
<i>The giant duck is on the pitch.</i>

996
01:10:26.412 --> 01:10:27.848
<i>He thinks it's all over.</i>

997
01:10:33.777 --> 01:10:34.926
<i>It is now!</i>

998
01:10:41.555 --> 01:10:43.310
Is this as good as you imagined?

999
01:10:43.787 --> 01:10:45.063
No.

1000
01:10:46.432 --> 01:10:47.611
It's better!

1001
01:10:47.613 --> 01:10:48.825
Yeah!

1002
01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:56.539
Well done, my old hoggy friend!

1003
01:10:56.890 --> 01:10:58.385
You cheat!

1004
01:10:58.387 --> 01:11:01.193
You are a disgrace to football!

1005
01:11:02.819 --> 01:11:04.159
Oh!

1006
01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:12.061
Hmm?

1007
01:11:12.063 --> 01:11:13.149
Good game.

1008
01:11:16.239 --> 01:11:17.929
<i>Ja.</i>

1009
01:11:17.930 --> 01:11:19.779
Well played, caveman.

1010
01:11:20.862 --> 01:11:21.948
So...

1011
01:11:22.392 --> 01:11:23.635
Huh?

1012
01:11:23.637 --> 01:11:28.069
You've reminded us how the
beautiful game should be played.

1013
01:11:29.948 --> 01:11:32.784
As for Lord Nooth...

1014
01:11:32.786 --> 01:11:36.006
Nooth? Nooth! Where is that...

1015
01:11:36.865 --> 01:11:39.193
- Rat!
- Yes, quite!

1016
01:11:41.966 --> 01:11:43.942
Guards!

1017
01:11:43.944 --> 01:11:46.559
Apprehend that rodent!

1018
01:11:47.514 --> 01:11:49.520
So long, suckers!

1019
01:11:49.522 --> 01:11:50.732
<i>My word, Bryan.</i>

1020
01:11:50.734 --> 01:11:52.581
<i>That schnookel-grabbing
scoundrel</i>

1021
01:11:52.583 --> 01:11:54.369
<i>is making off with the profits!</i>

1022
01:11:54.974 --> 01:11:56.120
After you.

1023
01:11:56.122 --> 01:11:57.809
<i>Aye, but will he get away?</i>

1024
01:11:59.692 --> 01:12:01.924
<i>- Oh, superb shot!
- And a rebound!</i>

1025
01:12:02.848 --> 01:12:03.802
<i>Oh, that got him!</i>

1026
01:12:03.804 --> 01:12:06.767
<i>Aye, Nooth is on
the back foot now, Brian.</i>

1027
01:12:07.418 --> 01:12:09.839
<i>Quite literally.</i>

1028
01:12:13.889 --> 01:12:14.940
<i>Look at that.</i>

1029
01:12:14.942 --> 01:12:17.204
<i>- Caught by the old bill.
- Oh, Bryan,</i>

1030
01:12:17.206 --> 01:12:19.469
<i>that's comedy bronze.
Well done, my friend.</i>

1031
01:12:28.236 --> 01:12:30.402
No! My lovely schnookels!

1032
01:12:36.556 --> 01:12:37.896
Yay!

1033
01:12:38.627 --> 01:12:40.699
Oh, refund.

1034
01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:43.698
That should remind him
of the pecking order, eh?

1035
01:12:43.903 --> 01:12:44.921
Yeah.

1036
01:12:44.923 --> 01:12:47.216
Oh, and, caveman,

1037
01:12:47.218 --> 01:12:50.088
I think this is yours.

1038
01:12:58.918 --> 01:13:03.030
Symbol of a game sent
from heaven.

1039
01:13:03.031 --> 01:13:04.942
Thank you, Your...

1040
01:13:04.944 --> 01:13:07.748
Bronze Chiefness.

1041
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:10.843
And now, I believe
it's time you went home,

1042
01:13:14.762 --> 01:13:16.389
to your valley.

1043
01:13:22.158 --> 01:13:23.593
We're going home.

1044
01:13:37.860 --> 01:13:39.677
Oh, hey!

1045
01:14:36.313 --> 01:14:41.090
